## Little Green Machine Losing Suction? Let's Fix It!

Is your trusty Little Green Machine failing to pick up dirt and water like it used to? Don't worry, you're not alone! A loss of suction is a common issue with this popular spot cleaner, but thankfully, it's often a simple fix. This article will walk you through the most likely causes of a Little Green Machine not suctioning and provide clear, step-by-step solutions to get it working powerfully again. We’ll cover everything from clogged hoses to full tanks, ensuring you can get back to tackling those stubborn stains quickly. Let's dive in and restore your Little Green Machine to its full cleaning potential.

**Takeaway:**

*   Check for clogs in the hose and spray nozzle.
*   Empty the dirty water tank.
*   Ensure the clean water tank is properly seated.
*   Inspect and clean the filter.
*   Verify the machine is assembled correctly.

**Why is my Little Green Machine not suctioning?**

A Little Green Machine typically loses suction due to blockages in the hose, a full dirty water tank, or a dirty filter. Addressing these common issues will usually restore the machine’s suction power.

## 1. Clogged Hose or Spray Nozzle: The Most Common Culprit

Often, the first place to look when your Little Green Machine isn’t suctioning is the hose and spray nozzle. Debris like pet hair, dirt, and fibers can easily accumulate, creating a blockage that restricts airflow. This is the most frequent reason for reduced suction. Start by disconnecting the hose from both the machine and the spray nozzle. 

### Inspecting the Hose

Carefully examine the entire length of the hose for any visible obstructions. You can try gently flexing the hose to dislodge any trapped debris. For stubborn clogs, run warm water through the hose to help dissolve and flush them out. A long, flexible brush can also be helpful for reaching deeper blockages.

### Checking the Spray Nozzle

The spray nozzle itself can also become clogged. Remove the nozzle and inspect the small openings for any buildup. Use a small pin or needle to carefully clear any obstructions.

## 2. Full Dirty Water Tank: A Simple Oversight

It seems obvious, but a full dirty water tank is a surprisingly common cause of suction loss. The Little Green Machine relies on airflow to create suction, and a full tank prevents this airflow. The machine is designed to shut off suction when the tank is full to prevent overflow. 

Emptying the dirty water tank is a quick and easy fix. Before emptying, ensure the machine is turned off and unplugged. Carefully remove the tank and dispose of the dirty water appropriately.  Then, rinse the tank thoroughly with clean water before reattaching it.  Remember to check the float inside the tank to ensure it moves freely.

## 3. Clean Water Tank Issues: Proper Seating is Key

Believe it or not, the clean water tank can also affect suction. If the clean water tank isn't properly seated, it can disrupt the airflow within the machine. This prevents the vacuum from creating the necessary suction to lift dirt and water.

Ensure the clean water tank is securely clicked into place. You should hear a distinct click when it's properly seated. If it doesn't click, try removing and reinserting it, making sure it's aligned correctly.  Also, ensure the cap on the clean water tank is tightly sealed.

## 4. Dirty or Clogged Filter: Restricting Airflow

The filter plays a crucial role in protecting the motor and maintaining suction. A dirty or clogged filter restricts airflow, reducing the machine's cleaning power. Regularly cleaning or replacing the filter is essential for optimal performance.

Locate the filter (usually near the clean water tank). Remove the filter and inspect it for dirt and debris. If it's washable (check your owner's manual), rinse it thoroughly with clean water and allow it to dry completely before reinstalling. If it's not washable, replace it with a new filter.

## 5. Assembly Errors: Ensuring Everything is Connected Correctly

Sometimes, the issue isn't a blockage or a full tank, but simply incorrect assembly. If the hose, spray nozzle, or tanks aren't properly connected, it can disrupt the airflow and prevent suction.

Double-check that all components are securely attached. Ensure the hose is firmly connected to both the machine and the spray nozzle. Verify that the tanks are properly seated and clicked into place. A quick review of the assembly instructions in your owner's manual can be helpful.

## 6. Inspect the Motor Area (Advanced Troubleshooting)

If you’ve tried all the above steps and your Little Green Machine still isn’t suctioning, there might be an issue with the motor itself. *This is less common and may require professional repair.* However, you can visually inspect the motor area for any obvious obstructions or damage. **Always unplug the machine before attempting this.**

Look for any loose wires or debris that might be interfering with the motor's operation. If you're not comfortable disassembling the machine further, it's best to contact Bissell customer support or a qualified repair technician.
