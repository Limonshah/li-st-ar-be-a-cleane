## Keeping It Bubbling: How To Clean A Blow Hot Tub

Let's face it, a blow-up hot tub is a fantastic way to relax and unwind. But just like any hot tub, regular cleaning is essential to keep the water sparkling and prevent the build-up of bacteria. This article will walk you through everything you need to know about how to clean a blow up hot tub, from daily maintenance to deep cleaning. We’ll cover the best practices for keeping your inflatable spa hygienic and enjoyable for years to come.  Maintaining a clean hot tub isn’t difficult, and the benefits of a relaxing, sanitary soak are well worth the effort.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly test and balance your water chemistry.
*   Clean or replace your filter frequently.
*   Shock the water weekly to kill bacteria.
*   Drain and deep clean your hot tub every 3-6 months.

**A Quick Answer:**

Cleaning a blow-up hot tub involves regular water testing, filter maintenance, weekly shocking, and a thorough drain and clean every 3-6 months. Consistent upkeep prevents bacteria growth and ensures a safe, relaxing experience.



## 1. Daily & Weekly Maintenance for Your Inflatable Hot Tub

Consistent, small efforts make a big difference when it comes to keeping your blow-up hot tub clean.  Think of it like brushing your teeth – a little bit every day prevents bigger problems down the road.  Start by simply removing any debris like leaves or insects with a net after each use. This prevents them from sinking and potentially clogging your filter. 

Here’s a breakdown of daily and weekly tasks:

*   **Daily:** Remove visible debris. Check water level and add water if needed.
*   **Weekly:** Test the water’s pH, alkalinity, and sanitizer levels using test strips or a liquid test kit. Adjust as needed to maintain proper balance.  You can find detailed instructions on water chemistry balancing on many hot tub supply websites.
*   **Weekly:** Shock the water with a non-chlorine shock to kill bacteria and algae. This is especially important after heavy use.



## 2. The Importance of Filter Cleaning & Replacement

Your hot tub filter is the first line of defense against dirt and debris. A clean filter ensures the water circulates properly and remains clear.  Ignoring your filter is like trying to breathe through a clogged nose – it just doesn’t work well!  Rinsing your filter regularly is crucial.

Here’s how to maintain your filter:

*   **Rinse:** Rinse the filter with a garden hose every 2-4 weeks to remove loose debris. Use a filter cleaning nozzle for best results.
*   **Deep Clean:** Every 3-6 months, perform a deep clean using a filter cleaning solution. This removes oils, minerals, and other contaminants.
*   **Replace:** Replace the filter every 12-18 months, or sooner if it becomes damaged or clogged.  A worn-out filter won’t effectively clean the water.

## 3. Shocking Your Blow Up Hot Tub: A Weekly Routine

Shocking your hot tub isn’t about giving it an electric jolt! It’s about using a chemical oxidizer to kill bacteria, algae, and other contaminants that build up in the water.  This process helps maintain water clarity and prevents unpleasant odors.  Non-chlorine shock is generally recommended for inflatable hot tubs as it’s gentler on the materials.

Here’s how to shock your hot tub:

*   **Turn on the jets:** This helps distribute the shock evenly throughout the water.
*   **Add the shock:** Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the correct amount of shock based on your hot tub’s size.
*   **Wait:** Allow the shock to circulate for at least 15-30 minutes before using the hot tub.
*   **Test:** After shocking, test the water to ensure the sanitizer levels are within the recommended range.



## 4. Deep Cleaning: Draining and Scrubbing Your Hot Tub

Even with regular maintenance, your blow-up hot tub will need a deep clean every 3-6 months. This involves draining the water, scrubbing the surfaces, and cleaning the jets.  Think of it as a spring cleaning for your spa!  This process removes accumulated grime and ensures a truly hygienic soak.

Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Drain the water:** Use the drain valve or a submersible pump to remove the water.
2.  **Clean the surfaces:** Use a mild soap and a soft cloth or sponge to scrub the interior surfaces of the hot tub. Avoid abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the material.
3.  **Clean the jets:** Use a small brush or toothpick to remove any debris from the jets.
4.  **Rinse thoroughly:** Rinse all surfaces with clean water to remove any soap residue.
5.  **Dry:** Allow the hot tub to air dry completely before refilling.  You can speed up the process with a clean towel.  



## 5. Choosing the Right Cleaning Products for Inflatable Hot Tubs

Not all cleaning products are created equal, especially when it comes to inflatable hot tubs. Harsh chemicals can damage the material and void your warranty.  It’s important to choose products specifically designed for inflatable spas.  Look for pH-neutral cleaners and non-chlorine shock treatments.

Here are some recommended products:

*   **Hot tub cleaner:** A mild, pH-neutral cleaner designed for inflatable hot tubs.
*   **Non-chlorine shock:** An oxidizer that kills bacteria without damaging the material.
*   **Filter cleaner:** A solution specifically formulated to remove oils and minerals from hot tub filters.
*   **Water test strips/kit:** To monitor pH, alkalinity, and sanitizer levels.  



## 6. Preventing Algae Growth in Your Blow Up Hot Tub

Algae can quickly turn your clear water into a murky green mess. Preventing algae growth is much easier than trying to get rid of it once it’s established.  Proper water chemistry and regular shocking are key to keeping algae at bay.  

Here are some preventative measures:

*   **Maintain proper sanitizer levels:** Ensure your sanitizer levels are within the recommended range.
*   **Shock the water weekly:** This kills algae spores before they can take hold.
*   **Keep the cover on:** When the hot tub is not in use, keep the cover on to block sunlight, which promotes algae growth.
*   **Clean the filter regularly:** A clean filter removes algae spores from the water.

## 7. Storing Your Blow Up Hot Tub Properly

When it’s time to store your blow-up hot tub for the season, proper preparation is essential. This prevents damage and ensures it’s ready to go when you’re ready to relax again.  A little effort now will save you headaches later.

Here’s how to store your hot tub:

1.  **Clean thoroughly:** Drain, clean, and dry the hot tub completely.
2.  **Deflate:** Carefully deflate the hot tub, following the manufacturer’s instructions.
3.  **Dry again:** Ensure the hot tub is completely dry before storing it.
4.  **Store in a cool, dry place:** Store the hot tub in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures.
