## Keeping Your Kenmore Washer Model 110 Fresh and Clean

Is your Kenmore Washer Model 110 not smelling as fresh as it used to? Don't worry, it's a common issue! Over time, detergent residue, fabric softener, and even mildew can build up inside your washing machine, leading to unpleasant odors and potentially affecting its performance. This guide will walk you through a comprehensive cleaning process for your Kenmore Washer Model 110, ensuring it stays clean, efficient, and ready to tackle your laundry needs. We’ll cover everything from cleaning the dispenser to sanitizing the drum.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning prevents odors and mildew.
*   Using the right cleaning agents is crucial.
*   A clean washer means cleaner clothes.

**Quick Answer:** To clean your Kenmore Washer Model 110, run a hot water cycle with washing machine cleaner, wipe down the exterior and dispenser, and clean the lint filter. Repeat this process monthly for optimal performance.

## Why Cleaning Your Kenmore Washer Matters

A clean washing machine is essential for truly clean clothes. Residue buildup can transfer onto your garments, causing them to smell musty or appear dingy. Beyond aesthetics, neglecting your washer can lead to mechanical issues, shortening its lifespan and potentially requiring costly repairs. Regularly cleaning your Kenmore Washer Model 110 is a simple preventative measure that saves you time, money, and frustration. It’s a small investment of effort for a big return in laundry quality and appliance longevity.

## Cleaning the Washer Drum: A Deep Dive

The drum is where the magic happens, but it's also where most residue accumulates. To start, you’ll need a washing machine cleaner. You can find these at most grocery stores or online. Pour the recommended amount of cleaner into the detergent dispenser. Then, select the hottest water setting and the largest load size. Run a complete wash cycle. This hot water and cleaning solution will loosen and dissolve built-up grime. For a more thorough clean, consider running an extra rinse cycle afterward to ensure all traces of the cleaner are removed.

### Dealing with Stubborn Mold and Mildew

If you notice black spots or a persistent musty smell, you likely have mold or mildew. For this, create a solution of one cup of bleach and one gallon of water. *Never mix bleach with other cleaning products.* Carefully pour this solution into the detergent dispenser and run a hot water cycle. After the cycle completes, leave the washer door open to air dry completely. This helps prevent the mold from returning. If you have a front-load washer, pay special attention to the rubber gasket, as this is a common area for mold growth.

## Cleaning the Detergent and Fabric Softener Dispensers

The dispensers are often overlooked, but they can harbor a surprising amount of residue. Remove the dispensers (refer to your Kenmore Washer Model 110’s manual for specific instructions). Soak them in warm, soapy water for about 30 minutes. Use a small brush, like an old toothbrush, to scrub away any remaining detergent or fabric softener buildup. Rinse thoroughly and allow them to dry completely before reinserting them into the washer. Regularly cleaning these dispensers ensures proper dispensing and prevents clogs.

## Sanitizing the Exterior and Control Panel

Don't forget the outside of your Kenmore Washer Model 110! Wipe down the exterior surfaces with a damp cloth and a mild all-purpose cleaner. Pay attention to the control panel, as it can accumulate dust and fingerprints. For stubborn stains, use a slightly more abrasive cleaner, but be careful not to scratch the surface. A clean exterior not only looks better but also helps prevent the spread of germs.

## Cleaning the Lint Filter: A Crucial Step

The lint filter traps debris from your clothes, preventing it from clogging the drain pump. Locate the lint filter (usually near the bottom of the washer). Remove it and clean it thoroughly after each load. You can use your fingers or a lint brush to remove the accumulated lint. A clogged lint filter can reduce the washer’s efficiency and even cause damage. Regularly cleaning the lint filter is one of the simplest, yet most important, maintenance tasks you can perform.

## Addressing Common Odors in Your Washer

Persistent odors can be frustrating. Here are a few tips to tackle them:

*   **Vinegar Rinse:** Add one cup of white vinegar to the rinse cycle to help neutralize odors.
*   **Baking Soda:** Sprinkle half a cup of baking soda into the drum and run a short wash cycle.
*   **Leave the Door Ajar:** After each wash, leave the washer door slightly open to allow air circulation and prevent moisture buildup.
*   **Check the Drain Hose:** Ensure the drain hose is properly connected and not clogged.
