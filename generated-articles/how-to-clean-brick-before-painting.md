## Preparing to Paint: How to Clean Brick Before Painting

Ever dream of a beautifully painted brick exterior? It’s achievable, but the secret lies in proper preparation. Cleaning brick before painting isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about ensuring the paint adheres correctly and lasts for years. This article will walk you through everything you need to know to effectively clean your brick surfaces, setting the stage for a professional-looking paint job. We’ll cover different cleaning methods, tools, and essential safety precautions.

**Takeaway:**

*   Remove loose debris with a brush and vacuum.
*   Wash the brick with a suitable cleaning solution (trisodium phosphate or a commercial brick cleaner).
*   Rinse thoroughly with water, ideally using a pressure washer.
*   Allow the brick to dry completely before painting.

**Quick Answer:** To clean brick before painting, remove loose debris, wash with a brick cleaner or trisodium phosphate solution, thoroughly rinse with water (a pressure washer works best), and let it dry completely. This ensures proper paint adhesion and a long-lasting finish.

## Why Cleaning Brick is Crucial Before Painting

Before you even think about opening a can of paint, understand *why* cleaning is so important. Brick is porous, meaning it has tiny holes that can trap dirt, grime, mildew, and even old paint flakes. If you paint over these contaminants, the new paint won’t bond properly. This can lead to peeling, blistering, and an overall unsightly finish. Cleaning removes these obstacles, creating a clean, sound surface for the paint to grip. A well-cleaned surface will also help you use less paint, saving you money in the long run.

## Assessing the Brick and Choosing Your Cleaning Method

Not all brick is created equal, and the best cleaning method depends on the brick’s condition and the type of soiling. Start by visually inspecting the brick. Is it covered in loose mortar? Are there signs of mildew or efflorescence (white, powdery salt deposits)? Is the brick simply dusty and dirty? 

Here’s a breakdown of common cleaning scenarios:

*   **Lightly Soiled Brick:** A simple scrub with soap and water might be sufficient.
*   **Moderate Dirt & Grime:** Trisodium phosphate (TSP) or a commercial brick cleaner is a good choice.
*   **Heavy Soiling, Mildew, or Efflorescence:** A stronger chemical cleaner and a pressure washer may be necessary. If you're dealing with stubborn mildew, consider a solution specifically designed for mildew removal.
*   **Old Paint Flakes:** These need to be scraped off before cleaning.

## Step-by-Step: Cleaning Brick with Trisodium Phosphate (TSP)

Trisodium phosphate (TSP) is a powerful cleaner, but it requires careful handling. Always wear gloves, eye protection, and a mask when working with TSP. Here’s how to use it:

1.  **Protect Surroundings:** Cover plants, windows, and other surfaces near the brick with plastic sheeting.
2.  **Mix the Solution:** Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for mixing TSP with water. Typically, it’s about 1/2 cup of TSP per gallon of water.
3.  **Apply the Solution:** Use a scrub brush to apply the TSP solution to the brick, working in sections.
4.  **Scrub Thoroughly:** Scrub the brick vigorously to loosen dirt and grime. Pay attention to areas with heavy soiling.
5.  **Rinse Completely:** Rinse the brick thoroughly with clean water. A pressure washer is ideal for this step, but a garden hose with a spray nozzle will also work. Ensure all traces of TSP are removed.
6.  **Allow to Dry:** Let the brick dry completely before painting – typically 24-48 hours, depending on the weather.

## Power Washing Brick: A Faster, More Effective Option

A pressure washer can significantly speed up the cleaning process and provide a more thorough clean. However, it’s crucial to use the right technique to avoid damaging the brick. If you're unsure, it's best to consult a professional.

*   **Choose the Right Nozzle:** Use a wide-angle nozzle (40-degree or wider) to avoid etching the brick.
*   **Start with Low Pressure:** Begin with a low-pressure setting and gradually increase it until you find the optimal cleaning power.
*   **Maintain a Safe Distance:** Keep the nozzle at least 12 inches away from the brick surface.
*   **Work in Sections:** Overlap your passes to ensure even cleaning.
*   **Rinse Thoroughly:** After cleaning, rinse the brick thoroughly to remove any remaining debris.

If you're dealing with stubborn stains, you can use a brick cleaning solution specifically designed for pressure washers. Remember to always follow the manufacturer’s instructions.

## Dealing with Specific Brick Issues

Sometimes, brick presents unique cleaning challenges. Here’s how to tackle some common problems:

*   **Efflorescence:** Use a commercial efflorescence remover, following the manufacturer’s instructions. These products typically contain a mild acid that dissolves the salt deposits.
*   **Mildew:** Mix a solution of bleach and water (1 part bleach to 3 parts water). Apply to the affected areas, let it sit for 10-15 minutes, and then scrub and rinse thoroughly.
*   **Old Mortar:** Carefully remove loose mortar with a chisel and hammer. Repair any damaged mortar joints before painting.
*   **Rust Stains:** Use a commercial rust remover specifically designed for brick. Be sure to test the product in an inconspicuous area first.

## Safety Precautions When Cleaning Brick

Cleaning brick can involve harsh chemicals and powerful equipment. Prioritize safety by following these precautions:

*   **Wear Protective Gear:** Always wear gloves, eye protection, and a mask.
*   **Work in a Well-Ventilated Area:** Ensure adequate ventilation when using chemical cleaners.
*   **Protect Plants and Surroundings:** Cover plants, windows, and other surfaces to prevent damage.
*   **Read and Follow Product Instructions:** Carefully read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning products.
*   **Be Careful with Pressure Washers:** Use caution when operating a pressure washer and avoid directing the spray at people or animals.
