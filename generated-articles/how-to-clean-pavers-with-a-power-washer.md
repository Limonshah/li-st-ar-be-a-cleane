## Revitalize Your Outdoor Space: How To Clean Pavers With A Power Washer

Are your once-beautiful pavers looking dull and dirty? Don't let grime and algae ruin your outdoor living areas! Cleaning pavers with a power washer is a highly effective way to restore their original luster and create a welcoming space. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know, from preparation to execution, ensuring a sparkling clean result. We’ll cover the best techniques for different paver types and common issues, so you can confidently tackle this DIY project.

**Takeaway:**

*   Choose the right nozzle and pressure setting for your pavers.
*   Sweep and pre-treat pavers before power washing.
*   Work in overlapping passes for even cleaning.
*   Re-sand joints after cleaning to maintain stability.

Cleaning pavers with a power washer is a straightforward process when done correctly. It involves using pressurized water to blast away dirt, mildew, and other debris that accumulate on the surface of your pavers. This method is much faster and more effective than scrubbing by hand, and it can significantly improve the appearance of your patio, walkway, or driveway.

## Understanding Your Pavers & Power Washer

Before you start, it’s important to understand both your pavers and your power washer. Different paver materials require different approaches, and using the wrong pressure can cause damage.  Consider the type of pavers you have – brick, concrete, natural stone, or travertine – as this will influence your cleaning strategy.  Similarly, familiarize yourself with your power washer’s settings and nozzles. 

*   **Paver Types:** Brick pavers are generally durable, while natural stone can be more delicate. Concrete pavers fall somewhere in between.
*   **Power Washer PSI:**  Most home power washers range from 1500 to 3000 PSI.  Start with a lower setting and increase gradually if needed.
*   **Nozzles:** A wider nozzle (40-degree) is best for general cleaning, while a narrower nozzle (25-degree) can tackle stubborn stains. Avoid using a 0-degree nozzle, as it can easily damage pavers.

## Preparing Your Pavers for Power Washing

Proper preparation is key to a successful power washing job.  This step ensures you remove loose debris and address any pre-existing issues before applying water pressure.  Start by thoroughly sweeping the entire area to remove leaves, dirt, and other loose particles.  This prevents them from being spread around during the power washing process.

Next, inspect the pavers for any weeds or grass growing in the joints. Remove these manually or with a weeding tool.  If you notice oil stains or other stubborn grime, pre-treat them with a paver cleaner specifically designed for the type of stain.  Allow the cleaner to sit for the recommended time before rinsing.

## The Power Washing Process: Step-by-Step

Now for the main event!  Start by connecting your power washer to a water source and selecting the appropriate nozzle and pressure setting.  Always test the pressure on an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t damage the pavers.  Hold the nozzle about 8-12 inches away from the paver surface and move it in a consistent, sweeping motion.

*   **Overlapping Passes:** Work in overlapping passes to ensure even cleaning and avoid leaving streaks.
*   **Angle:** Angle the nozzle slightly to avoid driving dirt and debris into the paver joints.
*   **Direction:** Work *with* the paver lines, not across them, to minimize damage.
*   **Consistent Speed:** Maintain a consistent speed to avoid uneven cleaning.

## Dealing with Specific Paver Issues

Sometimes, pavers require a little extra attention. Here’s how to tackle common problems:

*   **Algae & Mold:**  These thrive in damp environments. Use a nozzle with a slightly higher pressure and consider a paver cleaner with a mildewcide.
*   **Efflorescence:** This white, powdery substance is caused by salt deposits.  A mild acidic cleaner can help remove it, but test it in an inconspicuous area first.
*   **Stubborn Stains:** For tough stains like rust or grease, use a specialized paver cleaner and allow it to dwell for a longer period.
*   **Moss Growth:**  Moss can be slippery and unsightly.  A targeted blast of water, combined with a moss remover, can effectively eliminate it.

## Re-Sanding Paver Joints: Maintaining Stability

Power washing can sometimes remove sand from between the pavers, which can compromise their stability.  After cleaning, it’s crucial to re-sand the joints.  Use polymeric sand, which is designed to lock in place and prevent weed growth. 

*   **Sweep In:** Sweep the polymeric sand into the joints, ensuring they are completely filled.
*   **Compact:** Use a plate compactor or hand tamper to compact the sand.
*   **Water Activation:** Lightly mist the pavers with water to activate the polymeric sand. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for proper activation.

Properly maintained joints are essential for the longevity of your paver installation.  If you're unsure about the best type of sand for your pavers, consider consulting a professional.
