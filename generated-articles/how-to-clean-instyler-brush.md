## Keeping Your Style on Point: How To Clean Your Instyler Brush

Is your Instyler brush losing its luster? Do you notice buildup hindering its performance? A clean Instyler brush is essential for achieving smooth, shiny hair and extending the life of your favorite styling tool. This article will guide you through a simple, effective cleaning process, ensuring your Instyler brush continues to deliver salon-quality results. We’ll cover everything from daily maintenance to deep cleaning, so you can keep styling with confidence. 

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly remove hair from your Instyler brush after each use.
*   Deep clean your brush monthly with a gentle cleaning solution.
*   Ensure the brush is completely dry before using it.
*   Proper cleaning extends the life of your Instyler and improves styling results.

**Quick Answer:** To clean your Instyler brush, unplug it and let it cool completely. Remove loose hair, then gently wipe the brush head with a damp cloth and mild shampoo. For stubborn buildup, use a cleaning solution specifically designed for styling tools. Always ensure the brush is fully dry before using it again.

## Why Cleaning Your Instyler Brush Matters

Let's face it, your Instyler brush works hard! It encounters hairspray residue, styling products, and natural oils with every use. Over time, this buildup can significantly impact its performance. A dirty brush doesn’t heat evenly, leading to inconsistent styling and potential damage to your hair. Plus, product buildup can harbor bacteria, which isn’t ideal for your scalp health. Cleaning your Instyler brush isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about maintaining its functionality and protecting your hair.

## Daily Maintenance: Removing Hair After Each Use

The easiest way to keep your Instyler brush in top condition is to remove hair after *every* use. This prevents buildup and ensures optimal airflow. Simply unplug the brush and allow it to cool completely. Then, use the cleaning tool that came with your Instyler, or gently pull the hair away from the bristles. Don’t force it, as you don’t want to damage the brush head. Consistent daily maintenance will drastically reduce the need for deep cleaning.

## Deep Cleaning Your Instyler Brush: A Step-by-Step Guide

While daily maintenance is crucial, a deep clean is necessary at least once a month. This removes stubborn product buildup and ensures your brush is functioning at its best. Here’s how to do it:

1.  **Unplug and Cool:** Always unplug your Instyler brush and allow it to cool completely before cleaning. Safety first!
2.  **Prepare Your Solution:** Mix a small amount of mild shampoo or a specialized styling tool cleaner with warm water. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the brush.
3.  **Dampen a Cloth:** Dip a soft cloth into the cleaning solution, ensuring it’s damp, not soaking wet.
4.  **Wipe the Brush Head:** Gently wipe the brush head, removing any visible buildup. Pay attention to the bristles and the area around the heating elements.
5.  **Rinse (Carefully):** Use a clean, damp cloth to rinse away any remaining cleaning solution. *Do not* submerge the brush in water.
6.  **Dry Thoroughly:** Allow the brush to air dry completely before using it. This is extremely important to prevent electrical shock or damage to the brush.

## Tackling Stubborn Buildup on Your Instyler

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, stubborn product buildup remains. For these situations, consider these tips:

*   **Isopropyl Alcohol:** Dip a cotton swab in isopropyl alcohol and gently rub it over the affected areas. Alcohol is a great solvent for dissolving hairspray and styling products.
*   **Styling Tool Cleaner:** Invest in a cleaner specifically designed for styling tools. These cleaners are formulated to break down buildup without damaging the brush.
*   **Gentle Scrubbing:** Use a soft-bristled brush (like an old toothbrush) to gently scrub away stubborn residue. Be careful not to apply too much pressure.
*   **Consider a Brush Cleaning Tool:** There are specialized brush cleaning tools available that can help remove stubborn buildup more effectively.

## Preventing Future Buildup: Best Practices

Preventing buildup is always easier than removing it. Here are some best practices to keep your Instyler brush clean:

*   **Use Products Sparingly:** Avoid using excessive amounts of hairspray, mousse, or other styling products.
*   **Clean After Each Use:** As mentioned earlier, removing hair after each use is crucial.
*   **Store Properly:** Store your Instyler brush in a clean, dry place, away from dust and debris.
*   **Regular Deep Cleans:** Stick to a monthly deep cleaning schedule to prevent buildup from becoming a major problem.
*   **Consider a Heat Protectant:** Using a heat protectant spray can minimize product transfer to the brush.
