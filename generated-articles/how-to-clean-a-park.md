Litter is the most visible sign of a neglected park. Start by systematically removing all visible trash.  Work in sections to ensure you don’t miss anything.  Remember to separate recyclables whenever possible.  A clean park is a welcoming park, and removing litter is the most immediate way to improve its appearance.

Playgrounds and park amenities require special attention.  These areas are frequently touched and can harbor germs.  Use appropriate cleaning solutions to sanitize surfaces and ensure a safe environment for children and other park users.
