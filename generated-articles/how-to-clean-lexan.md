## How to Clean Lexan: A Complete Guide

Ever wondered how to get that streak-free shine back on your Lexan surfaces? Lexan, also known as polycarbonate, is a remarkably durable and versatile plastic used in everything from safety glasses and motorcycle helmets to skylights and machine guards. However, its clarity can diminish with dirt, grime, and scratches. This article will show you exactly how to clean Lexan effectively, keeping it looking its best. We’ll cover everything from routine cleaning to tackling stubborn marks, ensuring your Lexan stays crystal clear.

**Takeaway:**

*   Use a mild soap and water solution for regular cleaning.

*   For tougher stains, consider using a plastic polish specifically designed for polycarbonate.
*   Protect Lexan from harsh chemicals and extreme temperatures.

**What is Lexan and Why Does Cleaning Matter?**

Lexan is a brand name for polycarbonate plastic, celebrated for its high impact resistance and transparency. It’s significantly stronger than glass, making it a popular choice for safety applications. Keeping Lexan clean isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about maintaining its optical clarity and protective qualities. Dirt and scratches can reduce visibility and even compromise the material’s strength over time.

## Removing Stubborn Stains from Lexan

Sometimes, soap and water aren’t enough. You might encounter tougher stains like grease, ink, or adhesive residue. Don't worry, there are safe and effective ways to tackle these challenges. Isopropyl alcohol is a good starting point, but always test it in an inconspicuous area first.

*   **Grease & Oil:** Apply a small amount of isopropyl alcohol to a microfiber cloth and gently rub the affected area.
*   **Ink:** Try a plastic-safe cleaner specifically designed for removing ink. Avoid harsh solvents like acetone, as they can damage the Lexan.
*   **Adhesive Residue:** Gently scrape away excess adhesive with a plastic razor blade. Then, use a residue remover formulated for plastics.
*   **Tree Sap:** Use a dedicated tree sap remover, following the product instructions carefully.

## Polishing Lexan to Restore Clarity

Over time, even with careful cleaning, Lexan can develop micro-scratches that dull its appearance. Polishing can help restore clarity and remove these minor imperfections. Use a plastic polish specifically designed for polycarbonate. 

*   Apply a small amount of polish to a clean microfiber cloth.
*   Rub the polish onto the Lexan surface in a circular motion, applying gentle pressure.
*   Buff the surface with a clean, dry microfiber cloth to remove any residue and reveal the shine.
*   Repeat if necessary for deeper scratches.

Remember, polishing removes a thin layer of plastic, so avoid over-polishing. For more information on cleaning different materials, you might find [how to clean aluminum](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-aluminum) helpful.

*   **Harsh Solvents:** Acetone, bleach, and ammonia can cloud or dissolve the plastic.
*   **Strong Acids & Bases:** These can cause chemical reactions that damage the Lexan.
