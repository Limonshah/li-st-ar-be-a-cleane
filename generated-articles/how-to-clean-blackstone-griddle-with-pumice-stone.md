**Quick Answer:**

## Why Use a Pumice Stone on Your Blackstone Griddle?

A pumice stone is a fantastic tool for deep cleaning your Blackstone griddle. It’s a natural volcanic rock that provides gentle abrasion, effectively removing stubborn burnt-on food and grease without damaging the seasoned surface. Unlike metal scrapers that can scratch, a pumice stone offers a safer, more controlled cleaning experience.  It’s also a cost-effective solution, lasting a long time with proper use.  You’ll find it’s a game-changer for maintaining a smooth, non-stick cooking surface.

## Preparing Your Blackstone Griddle for Pumice Stone Cleaning

Before you even think about the pumice stone, some initial prep work is essential. First, scrape off as much loose food debris as possible with a metal scraper. This will make the pumice stone’s job much easier. Next, pour a small amount of water onto the griddle surface – this is *crucial*.  The water acts as a lubricant, preventing the pumice stone from scratching the seasoning.  Finally, ensure your pumice stone is also thoroughly wet. A dry pumice stone is too abrasive and can cause damage.

## The Pumice Stone Cleaning Process: Step-by-Step

Now for the main event!  Hold the wet pumice stone at a slight angle and begin scrubbing the griddle surface in gentle, circular motions. Avoid applying excessive pressure; let the stone do the work. Focus on areas with stubborn residue, but be sure to cover the entire cooking surface.  You’ll notice the grime lifting as you go.  Continue scrubbing until the griddle is clean, rinsing the stone frequently to remove accumulated debris.  Remember, patience is key – a gentle approach yields the best results.

## Rinsing and Drying Your Blackstone Griddle

Once you’ve finished scrubbing with the pumice stone, it’s time to rinse the griddle thoroughly. Use clean water to remove any remaining debris and pumice dust. You can use a spray bottle or pour water directly onto the surface.  After rinsing, dry the griddle completely with clean paper towels or a lint-free cloth.  Any remaining moisture can lead to rust, so ensure it’s bone dry before proceeding to the next step.  A completely dry surface is vital for proper seasoning.

## Re-Seasoning Your Blackstone Griddle After Cleaning

Re-seasoning is arguably the most important step after cleaning with a pumice stone. The pumice stone, while gentle, *will* remove some of the seasoning.  Pour a small amount of high-smoke-point oil (like flaxseed, canola, or avocado oil) onto the griddle surface.  Using paper towels, spread the oil into a very thin, even coat – think of it as barely there.  Then, turn the heat to medium-high and let the oil smoke off for about 15-20 minutes. This process polymerizes the oil, creating a new layer of seasoning.  Repeat this process 2-3 times for optimal results.  If you're unsure about the seasoning process, you might find helpful information on [how to clean a nonstick griddle](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-nonstick-griddle) as it emphasizes maintaining a protective layer.

## Maintaining Your Blackstone Griddle: Prevention is Key

Cleaning your Blackstone griddle regularly will prevent the buildup of stubborn residue, making future cleanings much easier. After each use, scrape off food debris while the griddle is still warm.  Then, wipe it down with a paper towel and apply a thin coat of oil.  This simple routine will keep your griddle in top condition.  Consider using a griddle cover to protect it from the elements when not in use.  Regular maintenance will extend the life of your griddle and ensure years of enjoyable cooking.
