## Cleaning Jalapenos: Say Goodbye to the Cough!

Have you ever tried to clean jalapenos and ended up in a coughing fit? It’s a common problem! The capsaicin, the compound that makes jalapenos spicy, is also an irritant.  This article will show you exactly how to clean jalapenos without coughing, making your cooking experience much more enjoyable. We’ll cover everything from the best tools to use, to techniques that minimize irritation, and even how to handle the aftermath if you *do* get a little spice in the air.  Let's dive in and learn how to prep these fiery peppers with ease.

**Takeaway:**

*   Wear gloves to protect your skin.
*   Work in a well-ventilated area.
*   Avoid touching your face while handling jalapenos.
*   Wash jalapenos under cool running water.
*   Don't forget to clean your cutting board and utensils thoroughly.

**Quick Answer:** To clean jalapenos without coughing, wear gloves, work in a ventilated space, and gently wash the peppers under cool water. Avoid cutting them until *after* washing to minimize capsaicin release into the air.

## Why Do Jalapenos Make You Cough?

It all comes down to capsaicin. This chemical is present in all chili peppers, and it’s what gives them their heat. When you cut into a jalapeno, capsaicin is released as a vapor.  This vapor irritates the mucous membranes in your nose and throat, triggering a protective cough reflex.  The more capsaicin released, the more intense the reaction.  Understanding this is the first step to preventing the cough.  It's important to remember that capsaicin isn't *harmful*, just irritating.

## Essential Tools for Safe Jalapeno Cleaning

Having the right tools makes cleaning jalapenos much easier and safer. You don’t need a lot, but a few key items can make a big difference.  First and foremost, invest in a good pair of disposable gloves. Nitrile or latex gloves work well, protecting your skin from the capsaicin oil.  Next, a small paring knife is helpful for removing the stem and seeds.  Finally, a clean cutting board and a sink with cool running water are essential.  You might also consider wearing eye protection, especially if you're sensitive.

## The Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Jalapenos

Now, let's get to the cleaning process.  Start by putting on your gloves – this is non-negotiable!  Next, gently rinse the jalapenos under cool running water.  Don't scrub aggressively, as this can release more capsaicin.  Focus on removing any dirt or debris.  Then, carefully remove the stem.  You can use a knife or simply twist it off.  After removing the stem, you can cut the jalapeno lengthwise and remove the seeds and membranes. These contain the highest concentration of capsaicin.  Remember to work in a well-ventilated area, like near an open window or with a fan running.

### Minimizing Capsaicin Exposure During Cutting

The cutting stage is where most of the coughing happens. To minimize exposure, try to cut the jalapenos *under* running water. This helps to wash away the capsaicin as it's released.  Alternatively, you can fill a bowl with water and cut the peppers submerged.  Another trick is to use a sharp knife. A dull knife requires more force, which releases more capsaicin.  Avoid touching your face, eyes, or any other sensitive areas while handling the peppers.  If you're dealing with stubborn residue on your cutting board, a good scrub with dish soap and hot water is usually sufficient.

## What To Do If You Accidentally Cough

Despite your best efforts, you might still experience some coughing. Don't panic! It's a temporary reaction.  The first thing to do is get some fresh air.  Step outside or open a window.  Drinking a glass of milk or eating a spoonful of yogurt can help neutralize the capsaicin.  Capsaicin is oil-soluble, so dairy products bind to it and reduce the burning sensation.  Avoid drinking water, as it will only spread the capsaicin around.  If you get capsaicin on your skin, wash it thoroughly with soap and water.

## Cleaning Up After Jalapeno Prep

Cleaning up is just as important as the cleaning process itself.  Dispose of the gloves, seeds, and membranes carefully.  Wash your cutting board, knife, and any other utensils that came into contact with the jalapenos with hot, soapy water.  You can also sanitize the cutting board with a diluted bleach solution.  Don't forget to wash your hands thoroughly, even if you wore gloves.  If you notice a lingering spicy smell, wipe down the area with a vinegar solution.  Proper cleanup prevents accidental exposure later on.
