## How to Clean Your Snowblower Carburetor

Winter is coming, and you want your snowblower ready. A common problem that stops snowblowers is a dirty carburetor. This small part mixes fuel and air for your engine. When it gets dirty, your snowblower cannot run right.

I remember one time my snowblower sputtered and died. I knew it was the carburetor, as old fuel had sat in it. Cleaning the carburetor saved me from buying a new one. It also saved me from paying a repair shop.

This guide helps you [clean your snowblower carburetor](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-small-engine-carburetor) step by step. We will cover why it gets dirty, what tools you need, and how to do the job. You will learn how to take it apart, clean it, and put it back together. You will also find tips for cleaning it without removal. Let's get your snowblower running strong for the snow season.

### Takeaway

Cleaning your snowblower carburetor is a critical maintenance task for smooth operation.
*   Always use fresh fuel and fuel stabilizer to prevent buildup.
*   Gather all necessary tools and safety gear before starting.

### How do you clean a snowblower carburetor?

To clean a snowblower carburetor, first drain old fuel. Then, remove the carburetor from the engine. Disassemble it, cleaning each part with carburetor cleaner and compressed air. Pay close attention to jets and passages. Reassemble the carburetor carefully, reinstall it, and fill with fresh, stabilized fuel.

### Signs Your Snowblower Carburetor Needs Cleaning

Your snowblower might give you clues when its carburetor is dirty. Ignoring these signs can lead to bigger problems. Recognizing them early saves you time and money. I have seen many snowblowers suffer from these common issues.

One clear sign is trouble starting the engine. If your snowblower cranks but does not fire up, the carburetor might be clogged. Old fuel leaves deposits that block fuel flow. This makes it hard for the engine to get the right fuel-air mix. You might pull the cord many times without success.

Another common symptom is rough running. Your snowblower might idle poorly. It could surge or hunt for RPMs. It might also stall frequently when trying to clear snow. This happens because the fuel delivery is inconsistent. The engine struggles to maintain a steady speed.

You might also notice a loss of power. Your snowblower might bog down easily under load. It will not throw snow as far as it used to. This is a sign that the engine is not getting enough fuel. A clogged carburetor restricts the fuel flow. This limits the engine's ability to produce full power.

Lastly, excessive smoke or unusual fuel consumption can point to a dirty carburetor. A rich fuel mixture, often from a partially clogged air passage or dirty jet, creates black smoke. A lean mixture, from a restricted fuel flow, can cause the engine to run hot and even damage it. Always check your snowblower's performance. These signs tell you it's time to clean the carburetor.

### Essential Tools and Supplies for Carburetor Cleaning

Before you begin cleaning your snowblower carburetor, gather all the right tools and supplies. Having everything ready makes the job easier and safer. I always prepare my workspace first. This prevents me from stopping halfway through to find a missing wrench. You will need a few key items for this task.

First, safety gear is important. Wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from fuel or cleaner spray. Also, use gloves to keep chemicals off your skin. Carburetor cleaner can irritate skin. You might also want a face mask if you are working in a poorly ventilated area.

You will need a set of basic hand tools. A screwdriver set with flathead and Phillips heads is essential. You will also need a socket set or wrench set. These help you remove bolts and nuts holding the carburetor in place. Pliers can be useful for hose clamps or stubborn connections. Make sure your tools are clean and in good condition.

Specific cleaning supplies are crucial for a thorough job. A can of carburetor cleaner spray is a must. This chemical formula dissolves fuel deposits and varnish. Compressed air, either from a can or a compressor, helps clear out small passages. Small wire brushes, like those found in a carburetor cleaning kit, are great for scrubbing tiny holes. You can also use thin wire or fishing line to clear out jets.

Finally, have some clean rags or shop towels ready. These help wipe up spilled fuel or cleaner. A container to catch old fuel is also needed. Some people also like to have a small parts tray. This helps organize screws and tiny components. With these tools in hand, you are ready to tackle the job.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Removing Your Snowblower Carburetor

Removing the snowblower carburetor is the first big step in the cleaning process. It might seem difficult, but take your time. Each snowblower model can be slightly different. However, the general steps are similar. I always recommend taking pictures as you go. This helps with reassembly later.

First, ensure safety. Disconnect the spark plug wire to prevent the engine from accidentally starting. Then, drain all fuel from the fuel tank. You can use a siphon pump or simply tip the snowblower if it has a drain valve. Catch the old fuel in a proper container. This prevents spills and fire hazards.

Locate the carburetor. It usually sits between the air filter housing and the engine block. You will see fuel lines and linkage rods connected to it. These rods control the throttle and choke. Carefully note their positions. Some snowblowers have a plastic cover over the carburetor. Remove any covers or shrouds that block access.

Next, disconnect the fuel line. Use pliers to slide back the hose clamp. Then, gently pull the fuel line off the carburetor. Be ready for a small amount of fuel to drip out. Have a rag nearby. Now, disconnect the linkage rods and springs. These are delicate. Use needle-nose pliers for small springs. Try not to bend or stretch them.

Finally, unbolt the carburetor from the engine. There are usually two or three nuts or bolts. These connect the carburetor to the intake manifold. Once the bolts are off, the carburetor should pull free. Watch out for gaskets. These are flat pieces of material that seal the connection. They might stick to the engine or carburetor. Carefully remove them if they are still attached. Keep them safe. If they are torn, you will need new ones. Now you have the carburetor in your hand, ready for cleaning.

### Deep Cleaning Your Snowblower Carburetor Components

Now that the carburetor is off, it is time for the deep clean. This is where most of the grime is removed. You will be dealing with small parts, so keep them organized. I like to lay out my parts on a clean towel. This makes sure nothing rolls away. This cleaning method works well for various small engines, including how to [clean a Briggs and Stratton carburetor](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-briggs-and-stratton-carburetor).

Start by disassembling the carburetor. The main parts you will likely remove are the fuel bowl, float, and float pin. The fuel bowl is at the bottom, held by a screw or bolt. Carefully remove it, as it will contain residual fuel and sediment. The float is inside the bowl. It pivots on a small pin. Gently slide the pin out to release the float and needle valve. This needle valve stops fuel flow when the bowl is full.

Once disassembled, soak the metal parts in carburetor cleaner. You can use a small pan for this. Let them sit for a few minutes to loosen deposits. For parts that cannot be soaked, spray them directly with carburetor cleaner. This cleaner is very powerful. It breaks down varnish and gum buildup.

The most important parts to clean are the jets and passages. These are tiny holes that control fuel flow. Spray carburetor cleaner directly into every opening you see. Use a can of compressed air to blow through these passages. You should see a strong, clear stream of air coming out the other side. If not, the passage is still blocked.

For stubborn blockages in the jets, use a thin wire from a carburetor cleaning kit. You can also use a strand of wire from a wire brush or a fishing line. Gently push it through the jet holes. Do not use anything that can widen the holes. This changes the fuel mixture. After clearing, spray again with cleaner and blow with compressed air. Make sure all channels are clear. Pay extra attention to [cleaning carburetor jets](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-jets-on-carburetor). Once all parts are clean and dry, you are ready for reassembly.

### Reassembling and Testing Your Cleaned Carburetor

After all the carburetor components are sparkling clean, it is time to put them back together. Reassembly needs patience and attention to detail. Remember those pictures you took during disassembly? Now they come in handy. I always double-check my steps at this point.

Start by reassembling the inner parts of the carburetor. Place the needle valve back into its seat. Then, position the float and slide the float pin back into place. Make sure the float moves freely. It should pivot up and down without sticking. This movement is important for proper fuel regulation.

Next, attach the fuel bowl. Ensure the bowl gasket is in good condition. If it is cracked or hard, replace it with a new one. A damaged gasket will cause fuel leaks. Carefully align the bowl and tighten the screw or bolt that holds it in place. Do not overtighten; you could strip the threads. Just snug it down firmly.

Now, you can reinstall the carburetor onto the snowblower engine. Place new gaskets if the old ones were damaged. Align the carburetor with the intake manifold studs. Then, carefully thread on the nuts or bolts. Tighten them evenly. Do not tighten one side fully before the other. This ensures a good seal.

Reconnect the throttle and choke linkage rods and springs. Refer to your pictures to ensure each rod goes back to its correct connection point. These connections must be precise for the snowblower to operate properly. Reattach the fuel line. Secure it with the hose clamp. Make sure the fuel line is firmly seated and there are no kinks.

Finally, reconnect the spark plug wire. Fill the fuel tank with fresh, stabilized fuel. Now, you can test your snowblower. Prime the engine if your model requires it. Then, try to start it. It might take a few pulls or tries for fuel to cycle through. Listen for smooth engine operation. If it starts and runs well, you have successfully cleaned your snowblower carburetor.

### Cleaning a Snowblower Carburetor Without Removal

Sometimes, you can fix minor carburetor issues without taking the entire unit off the engine. This method is quicker and less complex. It is great for light clogs or when you just want to perform quick maintenance. I use this method for small engines when I suspect minor fuel problems. This approach is similar to how you might [clean a lawn mower carburetor without removing it](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lawn-mower-carburetor-without-removing).

First, ensure the engine is cool and the spark plug wire is disconnected. This prevents accidental starts. You will need a good quality carburetor cleaner spray. Look for a product specifically designed for fuel systems. Some cleaners are formulated to dissolve gum and varnish without disassembly.

Locate the fuel shut-off valve on your snowblower, if it has one. Turn it to the OFF position. This stops fuel flow from the tank. If there is no shut-off valve, you might need to clamp the fuel line. Then, find the fuel bowl drain screw. It is usually at the bottom of the carburetor bowl. Place a small container beneath it. Loosen the screw to drain any old fuel and sediment from the bowl. This clears out some of the gunk. Once drained, tighten the screw.

Now, remove the air filter and its housing. This exposes the carburetor's air intake opening. With the engine off, spray carburetor cleaner directly into the carburetor's throat. Be generous. You can also spray into any visible fuel passages or jets if you can reach them. Let the cleaner sit for 5-10 minutes. This allows it to break down deposits.

After soaking, reconnect the fuel line if you disconnected it. Turn the fuel shut-off valve back to the ON position. Reinstall the air filter. Attempt to start the snowblower. It might smoke heavily at first, or take a few tries to start. This is normal as the cleaner burns off. Run the engine for 10-15 minutes to let the cleaner work its way through the system. If the issue persists, a full disassembly and cleaning will be necessary.

### Preventing Future Carburetor Problems: Best Practices

Cleaning your snowblower carburetor is a good skill. But preventing clogs is even better. Good maintenance habits keep your snowblower running reliably. They also extend its lifespan. I always follow these steps to avoid future carburetor headaches.

The most important step is using fresh fuel. Gasoline starts to degrade quickly. It can break down and leave sticky deposits. These deposits are the main cause of carburetor clogs. Always use fuel bought within the last 30 days. Avoid using old gas that has sat in a can for months. This simple habit makes a big difference.

Next, always use a fuel stabilizer. This additive slows down fuel degradation. It prevents gum and varnish from forming in your fuel system. Add the recommended amount to every tank of fuel. Do this even if you plan to use the snowblower soon. It is especially important for long-term storage. Run the engine for a few minutes after adding stabilizer. This ensures it circulates throughout the carburetor.

Proper storage of your snowblower is also key. When the snow season ends, prepare your machine for storage. You have two main options. The first is to run the fuel tank completely dry. Let the engine run until it uses up all the fuel in the tank and carburetor. This prevents any fuel from sitting and going bad.

The second option is to fill the tank completely with stabilized fuel. This leaves no room for air and moisture. Moisture can cause rust and corrosion in the tank and carburetor. Choose the method that works best for you. If you choose to leave fuel in, make sure it is stabilized fuel.

Finally, regular checks are beneficial. Before each snow season, inspect your fuel lines for cracks or leaks. Check your air filter and clean or replace it if dirty. A clean air filter ensures proper air-fuel mixture. These preventative measures keep your snowblower ready for action. They save you from unexpected breakdowns during a snowstorm.
