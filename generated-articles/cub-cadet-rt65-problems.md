We’ll cover everything from starting difficulties to issues with the hydrostatic transmission, helping you get back to mowing your lawn with ease. Let's dive in and get your RT65 back in top shape.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular maintenance is key to preventing many RT65 problems.
*   Starting issues often stem from fuel problems or a weak battery.
*   Hydrostatic transmission problems require careful diagnosis and may need professional repair.
*   Blade engagement issues can often be resolved with simple adjustments.

**What are the most common problems with a Cub Cadet RT65?**

The Cub Cadet RT65, while a reliable machine, can experience issues like starting problems, a faulty hydrostatic transmission, blade engagement difficulties, and engine overheating. Addressing these promptly can save you time and money in the long run.

## 1. Cub Cadet RT65 Starting Problems

A Cub Cadet RT65 that won’t start is frustrating, but often fixable. Usually, starting problems are related to the fuel system, the battery, or the ignition system. Let's break down the common causes.

First, check the fuel level and ensure you’re using fresh gasoline. Old fuel can degrade and clog the carburetor. If the fuel is good, inspect the air filter; a dirty air filter restricts airflow and can prevent starting. A weak battery is another frequent culprit, especially after periods of inactivity. Test the battery with a voltmeter – it should read around 12.6 volts when fully charged. If the battery is weak, try charging it or replacing it. If you're still having trouble, you might need to investigate the ignition switch or solenoid.

## 2. Hydrostatic Transmission Issues on the RT65

The hydrostatic transmission is a critical component of the RT65, enabling smooth speed control. Problems with the transmission are common and can manifest as jerky movement, loss of power, or complete failure. These issues can be costly to repair.

One common issue is low transmission fluid. Check the fluid level using the dipstick and top it off if necessary, using the correct type of fluid specified in your owner’s manual. Leaks in the transmission lines or pump can also cause problems. Inspect the lines for cracks or damage. If you notice any leaks, address them immediately. A clogged transmission filter can restrict fluid flow and cause performance issues. Replacing the filter is a relatively simple maintenance task. If these steps don’t resolve the issue, the transmission itself may be failing, requiring professional repair or replacement.

## 3. Blade Engagement Problems

Difficulty engaging the blades is another frequent complaint with the Cub Cadet RT65. This can be caused by a faulty PTO switch, a worn PTO clutch, or a problem with the belt.

Start by checking the PTO switch. Ensure it’s functioning correctly and that the wiring is secure. Next, inspect the PTO clutch. If it’s worn or damaged, it may not engage the blades properly. A loose or broken belt can also prevent blade engagement. Check the belt for wear and tear and replace it if necessary. Proper belt tension is also crucial; adjust the tensioner if needed. If the blades still won’t engage, the solenoid could be the issue.

## 4. Engine Overheating

An overheating engine can cause significant damage to your Cub Cadet RT65. Several factors can contribute to overheating, including a clogged cooling system, low oil levels, or a faulty thermostat.

First, check the oil level and top it off if necessary. Low oil can cause excessive friction and heat. Inspect the cooling fins on the engine for debris. Clean them thoroughly to ensure proper airflow. A clogged radiator or cooling system can also cause overheating. Flush the cooling system and replace the coolant if needed. If the thermostat is faulty, it may not regulate the engine temperature properly. Replacing the thermostat is a relatively inexpensive repair.

## 5. Fuel System Issues: Carburetor and Fuel Pump

Problems with the fuel system are common causes of performance issues in the Cub Cadet RT65. A clogged carburetor or a failing fuel pump can prevent the engine from receiving the fuel it needs to run smoothly.

A clogged carburetor is often the result of using old or contaminated fuel. Cleaning the carburetor can often resolve the issue. You can find helpful guides on [How to Clean Carburetor on Cub Cadet Riding Mower](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-carburetor-on-cub-cadet-riding-mower). A failing fuel pump may not deliver enough fuel to the engine. Test the fuel pump to see if it’s functioning correctly. If it’s not, replace it. Fuel lines can also become clogged or cracked, restricting fuel flow. Inspect the fuel lines and replace them if necessary.

## 6. Electrical Problems: Ignition Switch and Solenoid

Electrical issues can manifest in various ways, from a no-start condition to intermittent stalling. Common culprits include a faulty ignition switch or a failing solenoid.

The ignition switch controls the flow of electricity to the engine. If it’s faulty, it may not allow the engine to start. Test the ignition switch with a multimeter to see if it’s functioning correctly. The solenoid acts as a switch to control power to the starter. If it’s failing, the engine may not crank. Test the solenoid and replace it if necessary. Check all wiring connections for corrosion or damage. Loose or corroded connections can cause electrical problems.

## 7. Cub Cadet RT65 Won't Move – Drive Belt Issues

If your Cub Cadet RT65 isn’t moving, even when the engine is running, the drive belt is a prime suspect. This belt transfers power from the engine to the wheels.

Inspect the drive belt for wear, cracks, or breakage. A worn or broken belt will need to be replaced. Ensure the belt is properly routed around the pulleys. Incorrect routing can cause slippage and prevent the mower from moving. Check the belt tension. A loose belt will slip and not effectively transfer power. Adjust the tensioner to ensure proper belt tension.



## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How often should I change the oil in my Cub Cadet RT65?**
A: You should change the oil every 25-50 hours of operation, or at least once a year. Regular oil changes are crucial for maintaining engine health and preventing premature wear.

**Q: What type of fuel should I use in my Cub Cadet RT65?**
A: Use unleaded gasoline with a minimum octane rating of 87. Avoid using fuel containing ethanol, as it can damage the fuel system.
