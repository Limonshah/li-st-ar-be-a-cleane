## Keeping Your Kenmore Series 500 Fresh: A Guide to the Clean Washer Cycle

Is your laundry smelling less than fresh, even after washing? It might not be your clothes – it could be your Kenmore Series 500 washing machine! Over time, detergent residue, fabric softener buildup, and even mildew can accumulate inside your washer, leading to unpleasant odors and reduced cleaning performance. Fortunately, the Kenmore Series 500 comes equipped with a convenient Clean Washer cycle designed to tackle these issues. This article will guide you through everything you need to know about using this cycle effectively, ensuring your laundry always comes out sparkling clean. We’ll cover what the cycle does, how to use it, and tips for maintaining a fresh-smelling washer.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly use the Clean Washer cycle (monthly is ideal).
*   Use the recommended amount of washer cleaner or bleach.
*   Leave the washer door ajar after each wash to promote ventilation.
*   Periodically clean the detergent dispenser and washer filter.

**What Does the Clean Washer Cycle Do?**

The Clean Washer cycle on your Kenmore Series 500 is specifically designed to deep clean the interior of your washing machine. It uses hot water and a higher agitation speed to remove built-up residue and eliminate odor-causing bacteria. This cycle doesn’t wash clothes; instead, it cleans the drum, tub, and other internal components. Think of it as a self-cleaning function for your laundry appliance, helping it perform at its best for years to come.

## How to Run the Clean Washer Cycle on Your Kenmore Series 500

Let's get into the step-by-step process of using the Clean Washer cycle. It’s a simple process, but following these instructions will ensure optimal results.

1.  **Ensure the Washer is Empty:** Before starting, double-check that there are no clothes or items left inside the drum. An empty washer is crucial for the cycle to work effectively.
2.  **Add Washer Cleaner:** Your Kenmore Series 500 requires a cleaning agent to work its magic. You can use either a commercially available washer cleaner (like Affresh) or liquid chlorine bleach. Follow the product instructions for the correct amount – typically, about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of liquid bleach or one tablet of washer cleaner is sufficient.  Using too much can damage your machine, so measure carefully.
3.  **Select the Clean Washer Cycle:** Turn the dial or press the buttons to select the "Clean Washer" cycle. The location of this cycle may vary slightly depending on your specific model, but it’s usually clearly labeled. If you're unsure, consult your Kenmore Series 500 owner's manual.
4.  **Start the Cycle:** Press the "Start" button to begin the Clean Washer cycle. The cycle typically takes between 30 minutes to an hour to complete, depending on your model.
5.  **Wipe Down the Interior:** After the cycle finishes, wipe down the inside of the drum with a clean cloth to remove any remaining residue. This is a simple step that can make a big difference in maintaining a fresh scent.

## Understanding Different Clean Washer Settings

Some Kenmore Series 500 models offer variations within the Clean Washer cycle. Understanding these settings can help you customize the cleaning process.

*   **Clean Washer with Hot Water:** This is the standard setting and is generally recommended for most cleaning needs. The hot water effectively dissolves detergent buildup and kills bacteria.
*   **Clean Washer with Bleach:** Some models allow you to select a bleach option, which adds a stronger disinfecting element to the cycle. Use this option sparingly, as excessive bleach can damage your washer over time.
*   **Clean Washer with Extra Rinse:** This option adds an extra rinse cycle to ensure all cleaning residue is thoroughly removed. It’s a good choice if you’re sensitive to smells or have hard water.

## Maintaining a Fresh-Smelling Washer Beyond the Clean Cycle

The Clean Washer cycle is a powerful tool, but it’s most effective when combined with regular maintenance habits. Here are a few tips to keep your Kenmore Series 500 smelling fresh between cycles.

*   **Leave the Door Ajar:** After each wash, leave the washer door slightly open to allow air to circulate. This helps prevent moisture buildup, which can lead to mildew growth.
*   **Clean the Detergent Dispenser:** Regularly clean the detergent dispenser to remove any lingering residue. A buildup of detergent can contribute to unpleasant odors.
*   **Clean the Washer Filter:** The washer filter traps lint, hair, and other debris. Cleaning this filter regularly (every 3-6 months) will improve your washer’s performance and prevent odors. You can learn more about cleaning your washer filter at [https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-the-filter-on-the-kenmore-top-load-washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-the-filter-on-the-kenmore-top-load-washer).
*   **Use HE Detergent:** If your Kenmore Series 500 is a high-efficiency (HE) model, always use HE detergent. Regular detergent produces too many suds, which can leave residue and contribute to odors.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues with the Clean Washer Cycle

Sometimes, the Clean Washer cycle might not work as expected. Here are a few common issues and how to troubleshoot them.

*   **Washer Still Smells After Cycle:** If your washer still smells after running the Clean Washer cycle, try repeating the cycle with a different cleaning agent (e.g., switch from bleach to washer cleaner). You might also need to clean the detergent dispenser and washer filter.
*   **Cycle Won't Start:** Ensure the washer is properly plugged in and the water supply is turned on. If the cycle still won’t start, consult your owner’s manual or contact Kenmore customer support.
*   **Error Codes:** If an error code appears during the cycle, refer to your owner’s manual for a list of error codes and their corresponding solutions.

## Preventing Washer Odors: Best Practices

Preventing odors is always easier than trying to eliminate them. Here are some best practices to keep your Kenmore Series 500 smelling fresh.

*   **Don't Overload the Washer:** Overloading the washer prevents proper cleaning and can lead to detergent buildup.
*   **Use the Right Amount of Detergent:** Using too much detergent is a common cause of residue buildup. Follow the detergent manufacturer’s instructions and adjust the amount based on your load size and water hardness.
*   **Remove Wet Clothes Promptly:** Don't leave wet clothes sitting in the washer for extended periods. This can create a breeding ground for mildew.
*   **Consider a Monthly Deep Clean:** Make the Clean Washer cycle a part of your monthly cleaning routine. Consistent cleaning will prevent buildup and keep your washer smelling fresh.
