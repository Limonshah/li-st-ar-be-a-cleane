## Getting Rid of Hot Tub Scum: A Step-by-Step Guide

Is a ring of grime building up around your hot tub’s waterline? That unsightly buildup is commonly known as “scum,” and it’s a frustrating problem for hot tub owners. Don't worry, you're not alone! This article will walk you through exactly how to clean the scum off your hot tub, identify what causes it, and prevent it from returning. We’ll cover everything you need to know to keep your hot tub sparkling clean and inviting.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly balance your water chemistry.
*   Skim the surface daily to remove oils and debris.
*   Use a hot tub scum remover specifically designed for this purpose.
*   Clean your hot tub cover frequently.

**What Exactly *Is* Hot Tub Scum?**

Hot tub scum isn’t just dirt; it’s a complex mixture of body oils, lotions, dead skin cells, sweat, and even remnants of cleaning products. These substances combine with minerals in the water and create a sticky, unsightly film that clings to the hot tub’s shell, especially at the waterline. Addressing this issue promptly is important for both the aesthetic appeal and the hygiene of your hot tub.

## Identifying the Source of the Scum

Before you start scrubbing, understanding *why* scum forms can help you prevent it in the future. Several factors contribute to scum buildup. Body oils and lotions are major culprits, as they don’t readily dissolve in water. Sweat and dead skin cells also add to the problem, especially with frequent use. Improper water chemistry, like low sanitizer levels, can exacerbate the issue, allowing organic matter to thrive. Finally, a dirty hot tub cover can transfer contaminants into the water. Regularly checking your water balance and cleaning habits can significantly reduce scum formation.

## Essential Supplies for Scum Removal

Gathering the right tools makes the job much easier. You’ll need a few key items to effectively tackle hot tub scum. A soft sponge or cloth is essential – avoid abrasive cleaners or scrub brushes that can damage the hot tub’s surface. A dedicated hot tub scum remover is highly recommended; these are formulated to break down oils and grime without harming the tub. You might also want a mild dish soap (ensure it’s non-detergent) for extra cleaning power. Finally, have a bucket of clean water for rinsing. Don't forget gloves to protect your hands!

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Hot Tub Scum

Now, let's get to the cleaning! First, drain your hot tub. This allows you to access the entire surface and clean it thoroughly. Next, fill a bucket with warm water and add your chosen hot tub scum remover, following the product’s instructions. Apply the solution to the affected areas, letting it sit for the recommended time (usually 5-10 minutes) to loosen the scum. Then, gently scrub the scum with your soft sponge or cloth, working in circular motions. Rinse the surface thoroughly with clean water, and repeat if necessary. For stubborn areas, a small amount of mild dish soap can be added to the cleaning solution. Remember to thoroughly rinse away any soap residue.

## Maintaining a Clean Hot Tub: Preventative Measures

Cleaning the scum is only half the battle. Preventing it from returning requires consistent maintenance. Regularly skim the surface of the water to remove oils and debris before they have a chance to accumulate. Maintaining proper water chemistry is crucial; test and adjust the pH, alkalinity, and sanitizer levels at least twice a week. Encourage hot tub users to shower before entering the tub to remove lotions, oils, and sweat. Finally, regularly clean your hot tub cover with a dedicated cover cleaner – a dirty cover is a major source of contamination.

## Deep Cleaning Your Hot Tub System

While cleaning the shell is important, don't forget about the internal components. Over time, scum and biofilm can build up in the hot tub’s plumbing, affecting water quality and sanitation. Periodically use a hot tub plumbing cleaner to flush out the lines and remove any accumulated debris. This is especially important if you notice cloudy water or a persistent odor. Also, remember to regularly clean or replace your hot tub filter. A clean filter is essential for removing particles and maintaining water clarity.

## Dealing with Stubborn Scum and Biofilm

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, stubborn scum or biofilm persists. In these cases, you may need to shock the hot tub with a non-chlorine shock treatment. This helps to oxidize organic matter and kill bacteria. After shocking, be sure to run the jets for at least 20 minutes to circulate the water. If the scum is particularly resistant, consider using a specialized enzyme treatment designed to break down oils and biofilms. These treatments can be very effective in tackling tough buildup.
