## Understanding Your Banks Ram Air Filter

The Banks Ram Air Filter is designed for high-performance diesel engines, offering superior filtration and airflow compared to standard filters.

## Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Before you begin, you’ll need a few essential supplies. Having everything ready will make the cleaning process much smoother. Here’s a checklist:

*   **Banks Power Air Filter Cleaning Kit:** This is the recommended kit, containing a specialized filter cleaner and oil.
*   **Warm Water:** For rinsing the filter.
*   **Clean Bucket or Sink:** To hold the water and cleaning solution.
*   **Soft Brush:** A soft-bristled brush can help loosen stubborn dirt.
*   **Clean Rags:** For wiping down the filter housing.

## The Cleaning Process: Step-by-Step

Now, let's get to the cleaning! Follow these steps carefully for best results.

1.  **Remove the Filter:** Carefully remove the Banks Ram Air Filter from its housing. Note the orientation for reinstallation.
2.  **Pre-Clean:** Gently tap the filter to remove any loose debris. Avoid using compressed air, as this can force dirt deeper into the filter material.
3.  **Apply Cleaner:** Spray the Banks Air Filter Cleaner liberally onto the dirty side of the filter. Let it soak for about 10-15 minutes to loosen the dirt and grime.
4.  **Rinse:** Rinse the filter from the *clean* side out with warm water. This prevents pushing dirt further into the filter. Continue rinsing until the water runs clear.
5.  **Inspect:** Examine the filter for any tears or damage. If damaged, replace the filter.
6.  **Dry:** Allow the filter to air dry completely. This can take several hours, or even overnight. *Do not* use heat to speed up the drying process, as this can damage the filter.

Remember, patience is key during the drying process. A completely dry filter is essential for proper oil absorption.

## Re-Oiling Your Banks Ram Air Filter

Once the filter is completely dry, it’s time to re-oil it. This step is just as important as cleaning, as the oil helps trap dirt and debris.

1.  **Apply Oil:** Spray the Banks Air Filter Oil evenly onto the *clean* side of the filter.
2.  **Massage the Oil:** Gently massage the oil into the filter material, ensuring complete coverage. The filter should be evenly coated, but not dripping with oil.
3.  **Allow to Soak:** Let the oil soak into the filter for about 20-30 minutes. This allows the oil to fully penetrate the filter material.
4.  **Inspect:** Check for any areas that may have been missed and apply additional oil as needed.

Properly oiled filters maximize their ability to capture contaminants. If you're also interested in maintaining other parts of your vehicle, you might find this article on [how to clean air intake](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-air-intake) helpful.

*   **Frequency:** How often you clean your Banks Ram Air Filter depends on your driving conditions. In dusty environments, you may need to clean it every 2,000-3,000 miles. In normal conditions, cleaning every 5,000-7,000 miles is usually sufficient.
*   **Inspection:** Regularly inspect your filter for dirt and damage.
