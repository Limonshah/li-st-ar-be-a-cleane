## Keeping Your Floors Fresh: How To Clean Brushes On Your Bissell Proheat 2X Revolution Pet

Is your Bissell Proheat 2X Revolution Pet leaving behind more pet hair than it’s picking up? Dirty brushes are often the culprit! Maintaining clean brushes is crucial for effective cleaning and extending the life of your machine. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to keep those brushes spotless and your carpets looking their best. We’ll cover everything from quick daily maintenance to deeper cleaning routines, ensuring your Bissell continues to tackle pet messes with ease.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly remove hair and debris from the brush roll.
*   Deep clean the brushes with warm, soapy water.
*   Ensure brushes are completely dry before reinstalling.
*   Inspect brushes for damage and replace when necessary.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean the brushes on your Bissell Proheat 2X Revolution Pet, remove the brush roll, clear away any visible hair and debris, and wash it with warm, soapy water. Rinse thoroughly and allow it to dry completely before reinstalling.

## Why Cleaning Your Bissell Proheat 2X Revolution Pet Brushes Matters

Let's face it, pet hair is a constant battle. Your Bissell Proheat 2X Revolution Pet is designed to help you win that battle, but it can’t do it alone. Over time, hair, dirt, and grime build up on the brushes, reducing their effectiveness. This means you’ll need to go over the same areas multiple times, and your carpets won’t get as clean. Plus, a buildup of debris can strain the motor and potentially damage your machine. Regular brush cleaning ensures optimal performance and a longer lifespan for your carpet cleaner.

## Daily Maintenance: Quick Brush Roll Clean-Up

A little bit of daily maintenance goes a long way. After each use, take a moment to remove any visible hair, threads, or debris wrapped around the brush roll. This prevents buildup and keeps your machine ready for the next cleaning session. You can use scissors or a seam ripper to carefully cut away tangled fibers. Don't pull forcefully, as this could damage the bristles.

## Deep Cleaning Your Brushes: A Step-by-Step Guide

For a more thorough cleaning, you’ll want to remove the brush roll and give it a good wash. Here’s how:

1.  **Unplug the Machine:** Safety first! Always unplug your Bissell Proheat 2X Revolution Pet before performing any maintenance.
2.  **Remove the Brush Roll:** Refer to your owner’s manual for specific instructions on how to remove the brush roll. It usually involves releasing a latch or removing a cover.
3.  **Remove Debris:** Use your hands or a small brush to remove any remaining hair, dirt, or debris from the brush roll.
4.  **Wash with Soapy Water:** Fill a sink or basin with warm water and a mild dish soap. Gently wash the brush roll, paying attention to the bristles.
5.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse the brush roll under clean, running water until all soap residue is gone.
6.  **Dry Completely:** This is *crucial*. Allow the brush roll to air dry completely before reinstalling it. A damp brush roll can cause mold and mildew to grow, and it can also damage your machine.

## Addressing Stubborn Residue and Stains

Sometimes, soap and water aren’t enough to remove stubborn residue or stains from your Bissell Proheat 2X Revolution Pet brushes. If you encounter this, try these methods:

*   **Baking Soda Paste:** Mix baking soda with a small amount of water to create a paste. Apply the paste to the stained areas and let it sit for 15-20 minutes before scrubbing gently and rinsing.
*   **Vinegar Solution:** Dilute white vinegar with water (1:1 ratio). Use a cloth or sponge to apply the solution to the brushes, let it sit for a few minutes, and then rinse thoroughly.
*   **Enzyme Cleaner:** For pet stains and odors, an enzyme cleaner can be very effective. Follow the product instructions carefully. You might also find this helpful when you [clean Bissell Pet Pro](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bissell-pet-pro).

## Inspecting and Replacing Your Brushes

Even with regular cleaning, brushes will eventually wear out. Inspect your brushes regularly for signs of damage, such as frayed bristles, cracks, or warping. Worn-out brushes won’t clean effectively and can even damage your carpets. If you notice any damage, it’s time to replace them. Replacement brushes are readily available online and at most retailers that sell Bissell products. Don't forget to also check the condition of your [Bissell Crosswave brush roll](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bissell-crosswave-brush-roll) if you have that model.

## Preventing Future Buildup: Tips and Tricks

Preventing buildup is easier than constantly cleaning it up. Here are a few tips to help you keep your Bissell Proheat 2X Revolution Pet brushes clean:

*   **Pre-Vacuum:** Always vacuum your carpets thoroughly before using your Bissell Proheat 2X Revolution Pet. This removes loose dirt and debris, reducing the amount that ends up on the brushes.
*   **Empty the Dirty Water Tank Frequently:** A full dirty water tank can cause dirty water to be recirculated, contributing to buildup on the brushes.
*   **Use the Correct Cleaning Solution:** Using the wrong cleaning solution can leave behind residue that attracts dirt and grime. Always use a Bissell-approved cleaning solution.
*   **Rinse After Each Use:** After each cleaning session, run a tank of clean water through your machine to rinse out any remaining solution.
