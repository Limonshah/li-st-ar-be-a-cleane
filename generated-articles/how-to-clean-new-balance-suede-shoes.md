## Keeping Your Kicks Fresh: How To Clean New Balance Suede Shoes

New Balance suede shoes are a stylish choice, but that soft, luxurious material requires a little extra care. Don't worry, keeping them clean doesn’t have to be a daunting task! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to effectively clean your New Balance suede shoes and keep them looking their best. We’ll cover everything from quick daily maintenance to tackling tougher stains, ensuring your sneakers stay in top condition. Let's dive in and learn how to protect your investment and maintain that fresh look.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular brushing prevents dirt buildup.
*   Suede erasers are great for dry stains.
*   Use a suede cleaner for tougher marks.
*   Protect with a suede protector spray.

**Quick Answer:** To clean New Balance suede shoes, gently brush off loose dirt, use a suede eraser for scuffs, and apply a suede cleaner for stubborn stains. Always test cleaners in an inconspicuous area first, and allow shoes to air dry away from direct heat.

## Understanding Suede and Why It Needs Special Care

Suede is essentially leather with the underside of the skin turned outwards. This creates a soft, napped texture that’s prone to picking up dirt and water stains. Unlike smooth leather, suede doesn’t have a protective coating, making it more vulnerable to damage. Understanding this is the first step in properly caring for your New Balance suede shoes. Regular cleaning and protection are key to preserving their appearance and extending their lifespan. 

## Daily Maintenance: Preventing Dirt Buildup

The best way to clean your New Balance suede shoes is to prevent them from getting too dirty in the first place. A quick daily routine can make a huge difference. After each wear, use a soft-bristled brush – a dedicated suede brush is ideal – to remove loose dirt and dust. Brushing in one direction helps maintain the nap of the suede. This simple step prevents dirt from becoming embedded in the fibers, making deeper cleaning less frequent. Consider this your first line of defense against a dirty pair of shoes.

## Tackling Dry Stains with a Suede Eraser

Sometimes, you’ll encounter dry stains like scuffs or dirt marks. A suede eraser is your best friend in these situations. These erasers work similarly to pencil erasers, gently lifting the stain from the suede fibers. Apply gentle pressure and rub the eraser back and forth over the stain.  Don’t scrub aggressively, as this can damage the suede. After erasing, brush the area with a suede brush to restore the nap. For more stubborn marks, you might need to repeat the process a few times.

## Deep Cleaning: Using a Suede Cleaner

For more stubborn stains or overall cleaning, a dedicated suede cleaner is necessary. Always test the cleaner in a hidden area of the shoe first to ensure it doesn’t cause discoloration. Apply the cleaner to a clean cloth or the suede brush, and gently work it into the suede in circular motions. Avoid saturating the suede with cleaner; a little goes a long way. Once you’ve cleaned the entire shoe, use a clean, damp cloth to wipe away any excess cleaner.  Allow the shoes to air dry completely, away from direct heat or sunlight.  If you have other suede shoes, like [Birkenstock suede](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-birkenstock-suede), these methods will work well for those too.

### Choosing the Right Suede Cleaner

Not all suede cleaners are created equal. Look for a cleaner specifically designed for suede and nubuck. Avoid cleaners containing harsh chemicals or solvents, as these can damage the material.  Many cleaners come in spray or foam form, both of which can be effective. Read the product instructions carefully before use. A quality suede cleaner will lift dirt and stains without stripping the natural oils from the suede.

## Protecting Your Suede: Suede Protector Spray

Once your New Balance suede shoes are clean, protect them from future stains and water damage with a suede protector spray. This creates a barrier that repels liquids and dirt, making cleaning easier in the long run. Apply the spray evenly over the entire shoe, following the product instructions. Allow the spray to dry completely before wearing the shoes. Reapply the protector spray every few months, or more frequently if you wear the shoes often in wet or dirty conditions.

## Dealing with Specific Stains

Different stains require different approaches. Here’s a quick guide:

*   **Water Stains:** Blot immediately with a clean cloth. Allow to air dry, then brush with a suede brush.
*   **Oil Stains:** Sprinkle cornstarch or talcum powder on the stain to absorb the oil. Let it sit overnight, then brush away.
*   **Mud Stains:** Allow the mud to dry completely, then brush off as much as possible. Use a suede eraser for any remaining residue.
*   **Salt Stains:** Mix equal parts white vinegar and water. Gently dab the solution onto the stain with a clean cloth.

If you're struggling with a particularly difficult stain, consider consulting a professional shoe cleaner. They have the expertise and tools to handle even the most challenging cleaning situations.

## FAQ: Your Suede Cleaning Questions Answered

**Q: Can I use water to clean my New Balance suede shoes?**
