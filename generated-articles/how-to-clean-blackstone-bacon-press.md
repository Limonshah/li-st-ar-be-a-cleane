This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about cleaning your Blackstone bacon press, from quick daily wipe-downs to more thorough deep cleans. We’ll cover the best tools, techniques, and preventative measures to keep your press in prime condition. Let's dive in and learn how to properly care for this essential griddle accessory!

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly scrape off excess grease after each use.
*   Use warm, soapy water for daily cleaning.
*   Season your bacon press after deep cleaning to maintain its non-stick surface.
*   Avoid abrasive cleaners that can damage the seasoning.

**What's the best way to clean a Blackstone bacon press?**

The best way to clean a Blackstone bacon press involves scraping off excess grease after each use, washing with warm, soapy water, drying thoroughly, and occasionally re-seasoning to maintain its non-stick surface.

## Daily Maintenance: Quick Clean After Every Use

After each bacon-cooking session, a quick clean is essential. Don't let grease build up! Start by allowing the bacon press to cool slightly, but while it’s still warm. Warm grease is much easier to remove than cold, hardened grease. Use a [Blackstone scraper](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-blackstone-griddle-with-a-pumice-stone) to gently scrape away any leftover bacon bits and excess grease. 

This initial scrape prevents a significant buildup, making future cleaning much simpler. Next, wipe down the surface with a clean paper towel or a dedicated griddle cleaning cloth. You can lightly dampen the cloth with warm water if needed, but avoid soaking the press. This quick daily maintenance will significantly extend the life of your seasoning and keep your bacon press performing at its best.

## Washing Your Bacon Press: Soap and Water

For a more thorough cleaning, you can use warm, soapy water. Again, ensure the bacon press has cooled down enough to handle safely. Fill your sink with warm water and add a small amount of mild dish soap. Submerge the bacon press and use a non-abrasive sponge or brush to gently scrub the surface. 

Avoid using steel wool or harsh scouring pads, as these can remove the seasoning. Focus on removing any remaining grease or food particles. Rinse the bacon press thoroughly with clean water, ensuring all soap residue is removed.  Proper rinsing is key to preventing a soapy taste in your next batch of bacon.

## Drying and Preventing Rust: A Crucial Step

Rust is the enemy of any cast iron, and your Blackstone bacon press is no exception. After washing, it’s vital to dry the press *completely*. Use a clean towel to wipe away all visible moisture. Then, place the bacon press on a warm burner or in a warm oven for a few minutes to ensure any remaining moisture evaporates. 

This step is particularly important if you live in a humid climate.  Once dry, apply a very light coat of cooking oil to the entire surface of the press. This helps prevent rust and maintains the seasoning.  You can use any high-smoke-point oil, such as vegetable oil, canola oil, or flaxseed oil.

## Deep Cleaning and Re-Seasoning: When It's Necessary

Even with regular maintenance, your bacon press may eventually require a deep clean and re-seasoning. This is especially true if you notice rust forming or if the seasoning becomes uneven or flaky. To deep clean, you can use a mixture of baking soda and water to create a paste. 

Apply the paste to the bacon press and let it sit for 15-20 minutes. Then, scrub gently with a non-abrasive brush. Rinse thoroughly and dry completely as described above.  Re-seasoning is then essential. Apply a thin, even coat of cooking oil to the entire surface of the press. Place the press upside down in a preheated oven at 350-400°F (175-200°C) for one hour. Let it cool completely in the oven before using.  This process restores the protective seasoning layer.

## Dealing with Stubborn Grease and Food Residue

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, stubborn grease or food residue can cling to your bacon press. For these situations, consider using a Blackstone griddle cleaning brick. These bricks are designed to safely remove tough buildup without damaging the seasoning. 

Alternatively, you can try boiling water directly on the bacon press. This can help loosen stubborn residue, making it easier to scrape away. Be careful when handling hot water and the hot bacon press.

## Preventing Future Buildup: Best Practices

Preventing buildup is always easier than cleaning it up. Here are a few best practices to keep your Blackstone bacon press clean and well-maintained:

*   **Scrape after every use:** This is the single most important thing you can do.
*   **Use a light coating of oil:** Before cooking, apply a light coating of oil to the press.
*   **Avoid overcrowding:** Overcrowding the press can lead to uneven cooking and more residue.
*   **Store properly:** Store the bacon press in a dry place to prevent rust.
*   **Regularly season:** Maintain the seasoning by applying a light coat of oil after each use and occasionally re-seasoning in the oven.
*   Consider using a [Blackstone air fryer](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-blackstone-air-fryer) for alternative cooking methods to reduce the frequency of deep cleaning.
