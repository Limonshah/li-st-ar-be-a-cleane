## Cleaning Old Gas From Your Generator: A Step-by-Step Guide

Have you ever gone to start your generator during a power outage, only to find it sputtering and refusing to cooperate? Chances are, the culprit is old, stale gasoline. Gasoline degrades over time, losing its combustibility and potentially damaging your generator’s fuel system. This guide will walk you through how to safely and effectively clean old gas out of your generator, ensuring it’s ready to provide power when you need it most. We’ll cover everything from safety precautions to disposal methods, so you can confidently tackle this essential maintenance task.

**Takeaway:**

*   Drain all old fuel from the tank.
*   Clean the carburetor to remove residue.
*   Replace the fuel filter.
*   Use fuel stabilizer in fresh gasoline.
*   Properly dispose of the old fuel.

**Quick Answer:** To clean old gas out of a generator, first disconnect the spark plug. Then, drain the fuel tank completely, clean the carburetor, replace the fuel filter, and refill with fresh gas and stabilizer. Always prioritize safety and dispose of old fuel responsibly.

## Why Cleaning Old Gas is Crucial for Generator Health

Old gasoline isn’t just ineffective; it’s actively harmful to your generator. As gasoline sits, it undergoes chemical changes. This creates varnish and gum-like deposits that clog fuel lines, the carburetor, and other vital components. These deposits can lead to starting problems, reduced power output, and even permanent engine damage. Regularly cleaning out old gas is a preventative measure that extends the life of your generator and ensures its reliability. Think of it as a small investment that saves you from potentially costly repairs down the road.

## Safety First: Precautions Before You Begin

Working with gasoline requires strict adherence to safety protocols. Gasoline is highly flammable, and its vapors are explosive. Before you start, disconnect the spark plug wire to prevent accidental starting. Work in a well-ventilated area, away from any open flames, sparks, or heat sources. Wear safety glasses and gloves to protect your eyes and skin. Have a fire extinguisher readily available.  Proper preparation minimizes risk and ensures a safe cleaning process.  You can find more information on safe fuel handling practices from resources like the EPA.

## Draining the Fuel Tank: The First Step

The first step in cleaning old gas is to completely drain the fuel tank. Most generators have a drain plug located at the bottom of the tank. Place a suitable container, like a gasoline-approved fuel can, beneath the drain plug. Carefully open the plug and allow the old fuel to drain completely. If your generator doesn’t have a drain plug, you may need to siphon the fuel out using a siphon pump.  Be extremely careful when siphoning, and never use your mouth to create suction.  Once drained, inspect the tank for any sediment or debris. If present, you can rinse the tank with a small amount of fresh gasoline, ensuring you drain this rinsing gasoline as well.

## Cleaning the Carburetor: Removing Gum and Varnish

Once the fuel tank is empty, the next critical step is cleaning the carburetor. The carburetor is the heart of your generator’s fuel system, and it’s particularly susceptible to clogging from old gas. Remove the carburetor according to your generator’s manual. Disassemble the carburetor carefully, noting the location of each part. Use carburetor cleaner to thoroughly spray and clean all components, paying close attention to the jets and passages. Compressed air can help dislodge stubborn deposits.  If you're unfamiliar with carburetor disassembly, consider consulting a professional or watching a tutorial video.  A clean carburetor ensures proper fuel delivery and efficient engine operation.

### Addressing Stubborn Carburetor Deposits

Sometimes, even carburetor cleaner struggles with heavily varnished components. In these cases, you can soak the carburetor parts in a carburetor cleaning solution overnight. This allows the solution to penetrate and dissolve the stubborn deposits. After soaking, rinse the parts thoroughly with clean carburetor cleaner and use compressed air to ensure all passages are clear. Remember to reassemble the carburetor carefully, ensuring all parts are correctly positioned.

## Replacing the Fuel Filter: A Small Part, Big Impact

The fuel filter prevents debris from entering the carburetor and causing damage. Old gas often contains sediment and rust particles that can clog the filter. It’s best practice to replace the fuel filter whenever you clean out old gas. Locate the fuel filter (usually in the fuel line between the tank and the carburetor) and replace it with a new one. Ensure the new filter is installed correctly, with the arrow pointing in the direction of fuel flow. A new fuel filter contributes to a clean and efficient fuel system.

## Proper Disposal of Old Gasoline: Environmental Responsibility

Old gasoline is considered hazardous waste and should never be poured down the drain or onto the ground.  It can contaminate soil and water sources. Instead, take the old gasoline to a local hazardous waste collection facility or recycling center. Many auto parts stores also accept used gasoline for recycling.  Always transport the gasoline in a sealed, approved gasoline container.  Responsible disposal protects the environment and complies with local regulations.  You can also learn more about proper disposal methods from your local environmental agency.

## Preventing Future Problems: Fuel Stabilization and Storage

To prevent future issues with stale gas, always use a fuel stabilizer when storing gasoline for more than a month. Fuel stabilizer prevents the gasoline from breaking down and forming harmful deposits. Add the stabilizer to the gasoline *before* storing it. Store gasoline in a tightly sealed, approved gasoline container in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated area.  Regularly check your generator and fuel supply to ensure it’s ready for use when you need it.



## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long can gasoline sit in a generator before it goes bad?**
A: Gasoline typically starts to degrade after 30-60 days, even without use. After six months, it can become significantly less effective and potentially damaging to your generator. Using fuel stabilizer can extend this timeframe to around a year.

**Q: Can I just add fresh gas to the old gas in the tank?**
A: While you *can* mix fresh gas with old gas, it’s not recommended. The old gas will still contaminate the mixture, reducing its effectiveness and potentially causing problems. It’s best to completely drain and clean the system.

**Q: What if my generator still won’t start after cleaning the fuel system?**
A: If your generator still won’t start, the problem may lie elsewhere, such as a faulty spark plug, a clogged air filter, or a more serious engine issue. Consult your generator’s manual or a qualified mechanic.

**Q: Is it safe to use gasoline from a very old gas can?**
A: It’s best to avoid using gasoline that has been sitting in a gas can for an extended period, even if it appears clean. The gasoline may have degraded and accumulated sediment. Always use fresh gasoline and fuel stabilizer for optimal performance.



## Conclusion

Cleaning old gas out of your generator is a vital maintenance task that ensures its reliability and extends its lifespan. By following the steps outlined in this guide – draining the tank, cleaning the carburetor, replacing the fuel filter, and properly disposing of the old fuel – you can keep your generator in top condition. Remember to prioritize safety throughout the process and use fuel stabilizer to prevent future problems. Don’t let stale fuel leave you in the dark; take the time to clean your generator and enjoy peace of mind knowing it’s ready to power through any outage.
