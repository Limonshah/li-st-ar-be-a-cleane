Remove the spark plug wires or coil packs. Pull them by the boot, not the wire. Twisting gently can help loosen them. Use your spark plug socket wrench. Insert it onto the spark plug. Turn counter-clockwise to loosen. Do this slowly.

Once loose, pull the plug straight out. Be careful not to hit the electrode. Work on one plug at a time. This prevents mixing up wires. It also prevents dirt from entering open cylinders. Some people clean all plugs at once. Others prefer doing one at a time. This helps keep track of parts.

### Step 3: Inspect the Spark Plugs

Examine each spark plug carefully. Look at the ceramic insulator. Check the center electrode and ground electrode. Normal plugs have a light tan or gray color. Black, sooty deposits mean rich fuel mixture. White deposits suggest a lean mixture or oil burning. Oily plugs indicate oil leaks.

Look for physical damage. Cracks in the ceramic are bad. Worn or melted electrodes mean replacement. If the plug looks severely damaged, do not clean it. Replace it immediately. This inspection helps you decide if cleaning is worthwhile.

### Step 4: Gentle Cleaning of Deposits

This is the most critical step. Iridium tips are fragile. Do not use a wire brush on the tip. Do not use sandpaper or abrasive tools. These can damage the fine electrode. Damage ruins the plug's performance.

Instead, use a soft brush. A brass brush is okay for the threads. A nylon brush is better for the insulator. Spray the carbon deposits with a specialized spark plug cleaner. Carburetor cleaner or brake cleaner also works. Let it sit for a few minutes. The cleaner will soften the deposits.

Use a soft cloth to wipe away the loosened carbon. For stubborn spots, use a cotton swab. Gently scrape with a plastic scraper if needed. Avoid direct contact with the iridium tip. The goal is to remove buildup without abrasion. You can also clean spark plugs with WD-40, though a dedicated cleaner is often preferred for carbon buildup.
