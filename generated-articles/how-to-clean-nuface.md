## Keeping Your Glow On: How To Clean Your NuFACE Device

Is your NuFACE device looking a little less than sparkling? Maintaining a clean NuFACE isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s crucial for hygiene and ensuring your microcurrent treatments remain effective. A dirty device can harbor bacteria, potentially leading to skin irritation. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about how to clean your NuFACE, from daily wipe-downs to deep cleaning routines, so you can continue enjoying a lifted, toned complexion. We’ll cover daily care, proper cleaning solutions, and storage to maximize your device’s lifespan.

**Takeaway:**

*   Clean your NuFACE after *every* use with a soft cloth and 70% isopropyl alcohol.
*   Deep clean your device monthly with a gentle cleanser and warm water.
*   Store your NuFACE in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean your NuFACE, wipe the device with a soft cloth dampened with 70% isopropyl alcohol after each use. Monthly, gently wash the device with warm water and a mild cleanser, ensuring it’s completely dry before storing.



## Daily NuFACE Cleaning: A Quick Routine

After each microcurrent facial, a quick clean is essential. Think of it like washing your face – you wouldn’t skip that step, would you? This daily routine prevents buildup of skincare product residue and keeps your device hygienic. It only takes a minute and makes a big difference. 

*   First, ensure your NuFACE device is turned off.
*   Dampen a soft, lint-free cloth with 70% isopropyl alcohol. Avoid using abrasive materials that could scratch the device’s surface.
*   Gently wipe down the conductive spheres and the entire device surface. Pay close attention to areas that come into direct contact with your skin.
*   Allow the device to air dry completely before storing it. 

Maintaining this simple habit will significantly extend the life of your NuFACE and keep your skin happy. If you're looking for ways to keep other parts of your beauty routine clean, consider [how to clean your makeup brushes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-makeup-brushes).



## Deep Cleaning Your NuFACE: Monthly Maintenance

While daily cleaning keeps things fresh, a more thorough deep clean is needed monthly. This removes any lingering residue and ensures optimal conductivity. Don't worry, it's still a simple process!

*   Turn off your NuFACE device and disconnect it from the power source.
*   Fill a small bowl with lukewarm water and add a few drops of a mild, non-abrasive cleanser. Avoid harsh chemicals or strong detergents.
*   Dip a soft cloth into the soapy water and gently wipe down the entire device, including the conductive spheres.
*   Rinse the cloth with clean water and wipe the device again to remove any soap residue.
*   Thoroughly dry the device with a clean, lint-free cloth. Ensure no water remains in any crevices.



## Choosing the Right Cleaning Solutions for Your NuFACE

Using the correct cleaning solutions is vital to avoid damaging your NuFACE device. Some products can corrode the metal or degrade the plastic components. Always prioritize gentle options.

*   **70% Isopropyl Alcohol:** This is your go-to for daily cleaning. It effectively disinfects and evaporates quickly.
*   **Mild Soap:** A gentle, fragrance-free soap is perfect for deep cleaning. Baby shampoo or a mild facial cleanser work well.
*   **Avoid:** Harsh chemicals like bleach, acetone, or abrasive cleaners. These can damage the device and void your warranty. 
*   **Distilled Water:** Using distilled water for rinsing can prevent mineral buildup on the conductive spheres.

Remember, when in doubt, less is more. A small amount of gentle cleanser is always better than a harsh chemical. If you're concerned about cleaning other appliances, you can learn [how to clean a coffee maker](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-braun-coffee-maker-with-clean-button).



## Proper Storage to Protect Your Investment

How you store your NuFACE when it’s not in use is just as important as how you clean it. Proper storage protects the device from damage and extends its lifespan. 

*   **Cool, Dry Place:** Store your NuFACE in a cool, dry location away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures.
*   **Protective Case:** If your NuFACE came with a protective case, always store it inside.
*   **Avoid Moisture:** Never store the device in a humid environment, such as a bathroom.
*   **Cord Management:**  Keep the power cord neatly coiled to prevent damage.

Taking these simple steps will ensure your NuFACE is ready to deliver a revitalizing treatment whenever you need it.



## Troubleshooting Common Cleaning Issues

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, you might encounter a few cleaning challenges. Here’s how to address them:

*   **Stubborn Residue:** If you notice stubborn residue on the conductive spheres, try soaking a cotton swab in 70% isopropyl alcohol and gently cleaning the area.
*   **Water Inside the Device:** If water accidentally gets inside the device, immediately turn it off and allow it to dry completely before attempting to use it.
*   **Discolored Spheres:** Over time, the conductive spheres may become discolored. This is usually harmless but can be minimized with regular cleaning.
*   **Device Malfunction:** If your NuFACE malfunctions after cleaning, consult the manufacturer’s instructions or contact customer support.

Don't hesitate to reach out to NuFACE customer support if you have any concerns about cleaning or maintaining your device.



## Extending the Life of Your NuFACE: Beyond Cleaning

Cleaning is a huge part of NuFACE maintenance, but there are other things you can do to keep it running smoothly. Consider these tips for maximizing your investment.

*   **Use Recommended Conductive Gel:** Always use the NuFACE conductive gel with your device. Other gels may not provide optimal conductivity and could damage the spheres.
*   **Follow Usage Guidelines:** Adhere to the recommended usage guidelines provided by NuFACE. Overuse can strain the device and shorten its lifespan.
*   **Regular Software Updates:** If your NuFACE has software update capabilities, ensure it’s always running the latest version.
*   **Handle with Care:** Avoid dropping or subjecting the device to physical shock.

By following these guidelines, you can enjoy the benefits of your NuFACE for years to come. If you're looking for ways to keep your home sparkling, you can learn [how to clean your home](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-home).
