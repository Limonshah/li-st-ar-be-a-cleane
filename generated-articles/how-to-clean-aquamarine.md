This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about how to clean aquamarine, ensuring it remains a beautiful centerpiece in your collection for years to come. We’ll cover safe cleaning methods, preventative care, and what to avoid when handling this gorgeous gemstone. Let's dive in and learn how to keep your aquamarine looking its best.

Aquamarine is a beautiful and durable gemstone, but it still requires proper care. Cleaning aquamarine regularly will maintain its brilliance and prevent the buildup of dirt and oils. This article will provide you with the knowledge to confidently clean your aquamarine jewelry at home.

### Understanding Aquamarine’s Properties

Before we begin, it’s helpful to understand what aquamarine is. Aquamarine is a blue to blue-green variety of beryl, a mineral also including emerald and morganite. It scores a 7.5-8 on the Mohs hardness scale, making it relatively durable, but still susceptible to scratches and damage from harsh chemicals. Knowing this helps us choose the right cleaning methods.  Aquamarine’s clarity and color are what make it so desirable, and proper cleaning helps preserve these qualities.  Regular cleaning will prevent dullness and ensure the stone continues to catch the light beautifully.

### The Gentle Approach: Daily & Weekly Cleaning

For everyday maintenance, a simple cleaning routine is all you need.  Warm water and mild dish soap are your best friends when it comes to keeping your aquamarine sparkling.  Mix a few drops of dish soap with warm water, then gently scrub the aquamarine with a soft-bristled brush, like a baby toothbrush.  This is especially useful for getting into intricate settings. Rinse thoroughly under warm running water and dry with a soft, lint-free cloth.  You can do this weekly to prevent buildup.

### Deep Cleaning Aquamarine Jewelry

Sometimes, your aquamarine jewelry needs a more thorough cleaning. This is especially true if it’s been exposed to lotions, perfumes, or other chemicals.  Soak the jewelry in warm, soapy water for about 20-30 minutes. This helps loosen any stubborn dirt or grime.  After soaking, gently scrub with a soft brush, paying attention to the back of the stone where dirt can accumulate.  Rinse thoroughly and inspect for any remaining residue.  If needed, repeat the process.  Remember to always handle your aquamarine with care during this process.

### What to Avoid When Cleaning Aquamarine

Certain cleaning methods can actually damage your aquamarine. Harsh chemicals, like chlorine bleach, ammonia, and strong detergents, should *never* be used. These can dull the stone’s luster and even cause discoloration.  Avoid ultrasonic cleaners, as the vibrations can potentially loosen the stone from its setting.  Also, steer clear of abrasive cleaners, like baking soda or scouring powders, as they can scratch the surface.  Protecting your aquamarine from these damaging elements is crucial for its longevity.  If you're unsure about cleaning a particular piece, it's always best to consult a professional jeweler.

### Cleaning Aquamarine with Different Settings

The setting of your aquamarine jewelry impacts how you should clean it. For example, aquamarine set in gold or platinum can withstand a bit more gentle scrubbing than those set in more delicate metals.  If your aquamarine is set in a prong setting, be extra careful not to snag the brush on the prongs.  For pieces with multiple stones, pay attention to the spaces between them to ensure all dirt is removed.  If you have aquamarine jewelry with other gemstones, consider their cleaning requirements as well.

### Storage: Protecting Your Aquamarine

Proper storage is just as important as cleaning.  Aquamarine can be scratched by harder gemstones, so it’s best to store it separately from diamonds, rubies, and sapphires.  Wrap each piece of aquamarine jewelry in a soft cloth or place it in a separate jewelry box compartment.  Avoid exposing your aquamarine to direct sunlight for extended periods, as this can fade its color over time.  Storing your aquamarine correctly will help prevent scratches and maintain its vibrant hue.  Consider using anti-tarnish strips in your jewelry box to further protect your pieces.
