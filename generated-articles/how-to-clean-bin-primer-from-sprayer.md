## Cleaning Bin Primer From Your Sprayer: A Step-by-Step Guide

Have you just finished a project using BIN shellac-based primer and are now staring at a sprayer covered in sticky residue? Don't worry, it's a common situation! Cleaning bin primer from a sprayer requires a bit more effort than water-based paints, but with the right approach, you can get your equipment spotless and ready for your next project. This article will walk you through everything you need to know to effectively clean bin primer from your sprayer, ensuring optimal performance and longevity.

**Takeaway:**

*   Disassemble your sprayer completely.
*   Use denatured alcohol as the primary cleaning solvent.
*   Flush thoroughly with clean solvent until no primer remains.
*   Lubricate components before reassembly.
*   Proper cleaning extends the life of your sprayer.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean bin primer from a sprayer, disassemble it, flush all parts with denatured alcohol, scrub any stubborn residue, rinse thoroughly, and lubricate before reassembling. This ensures the sprayer functions correctly for future projects.

## Why Cleaning Bin Primer is Different

BIN primer is fantastic for blocking stains, sealing odors, and providing a superior base for paint. However, its shellac base makes it stickier and more difficult to remove than latex or acrylic primers.  Water alone won’t cut it; you need a solvent that can dissolve the shellac. Ignoring this and using the wrong cleaning method can lead to clogged nozzles, uneven spray patterns, and ultimately, a damaged sprayer.  Proper cleaning is crucial for maintaining the performance and extending the lifespan of your valuable spraying equipment.

## What You’ll Need to Clean Your Sprayer

Before you begin, gather the necessary supplies. Having everything on hand will make the process smoother and more efficient. Here’s a checklist:

*   **Denatured Alcohol:** This is the most effective solvent for dissolving BIN primer.
*   **Cleaning Brushes:** Small brushes, like old toothbrushes, are perfect for scrubbing tight spaces.
*   **Cleaning Rags:** Lint-free rags are essential for wiping down components.
*   **Buckets or Containers:**  You’ll need containers to hold the cleaning solvent and rinse water.
*   **Sprayer Wrench (if applicable):** Some sprayers require a wrench for disassembly.
*   **Protective Gear:** Gloves and eye protection are recommended when working with solvents.
*   **Lubricant:** A silicone-based lubricant will help keep your sprayer functioning smoothly. You can find more information on sprayer maintenance at [https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-backpack-sprayer](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-backpack-sprayer).



## Step-by-Step Cleaning Process

Now, let's get down to the cleaning process.  Follow these steps carefully to ensure a thorough clean.

1.  **Disassemble the Sprayer:** Completely disassemble your sprayer according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This includes removing the nozzle, filters, and any other removable parts.
2.  **Flush with Denatured Alcohol:** Pour denatured alcohol into a bucket and flush the sprayer body, nozzle, and other components with the solvent.  Repeat this process several times until the alcohol runs clear.
3.  **Scrub Stubborn Residue:** Use your cleaning brushes to scrub away any remaining primer residue. Pay close attention to the nozzle and filters, as these are prone to clogging.
4.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Once you’ve scrubbed away the residue, rinse all components thoroughly with clean denatured alcohol. This ensures all traces of primer are removed.
5.  **Inspect and Repeat:** Inspect all parts for any remaining primer. If necessary, repeat steps 2-4 until everything is completely clean.
6.  **Lubricate:** After cleaning and drying, lubricate the sprayer’s moving parts with a silicone-based lubricant. This will help prevent corrosion and ensure smooth operation.



## Dealing with Clogged Nozzles

Clogged nozzles are a common problem when working with BIN primer.  Here’s how to tackle them:

*   **Soak in Alcohol:** Soak the clogged nozzle in denatured alcohol for several hours, or even overnight.
*   **Use a Nozzle Cleaning Wire:** Gently use a nozzle cleaning wire to dislodge any hardened primer. Be careful not to damage the nozzle.
*   **Compressed Air:**  If you have access to compressed air, carefully blow air through the nozzle to clear any remaining debris.  
*   **Consider Replacement:** If the nozzle remains clogged despite your best efforts, it may be time to replace it.  You can learn more about maintaining your sprayer at [https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-an-electric-paint-sprayer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-an-electric-paint-sprayer).

## Choosing the Right Cleaning Solvent: Denatured Alcohol vs. Other Options

While denatured alcohol is the gold standard for cleaning BIN primer, you might wonder about other options.  Acetone can also dissolve shellac, but it's more aggressive and can damage some sprayer components.  Mineral spirits are generally ineffective against shellac and should be avoided.  Water, as mentioned earlier, is simply not strong enough to break down the primer.  Stick with denatured alcohol for the safest and most effective cleaning experience.

## Preventing Future Build-Up & Maintaining Your Sprayer

Preventing primer build-up is easier than dealing with it after it happens.  Here are a few tips:

*   **Clean Immediately:** Clean your sprayer immediately after each use, before the primer has a chance to dry and harden.
*   **Strain Primer:** Strain your primer through a fine-mesh filter before pouring it into the sprayer. This will remove any particles that could cause clogging.
*   **Regular Maintenance:** Perform regular maintenance on your sprayer, including lubricating moving parts and replacing worn components.
*   **Proper Storage:** Store your sprayer in a clean, dry place when not in use.



## FAQ: Common Questions About Cleaning Bin Primer From Sprayers

**Q: Can I use lacquer thinner to clean BIN primer from my sprayer?**

A: While lacquer thinner *can* dissolve shellac, it's often too harsh and can damage the plastic components of your sprayer. Denatured alcohol is a safer and more effective option.

**Q: How long should I soak a clogged nozzle in denatured alcohol?**

A:  Soak the nozzle for at least several hours, or ideally overnight, to allow the alcohol to fully dissolve the hardened primer.

**Q: Is it safe to dispose of denatured alcohol down the drain?**

A: No, denatured alcohol should not be poured down the drain. It's considered hazardous waste and should be disposed of properly according to local regulations.

**Q: What if I still have residue after cleaning with denatured alcohol?**

A:  Repeat the cleaning process, focusing on the areas with remaining residue. You may need to scrub more vigorously or soak the parts for a longer period.
