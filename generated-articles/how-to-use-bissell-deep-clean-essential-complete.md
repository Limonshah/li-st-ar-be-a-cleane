This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to use your machine effectively, from initial setup to achieving a sparkling clean. We’ll cover each step, ensuring you get the most out of your Bissell investment. Let’s dive in and learn how to use the Bissell Deep Clean Essential Complete!

**Takeaway:**

*   Prepare your machine correctly with the right solution and water.
*   Understand the different settings and attachments for various cleaning needs.
*   Follow a consistent cleaning pattern for optimal results.
*   Maintain your machine properly to ensure longevity and performance.

**Quick Answer:** To use the Bissell Deep Clean Essential Complete, fill the clean tank with warm water and Bissell cleaning solution, attach the appropriate tool, select your cleaning mode, and slowly push and pull the machine across the surface, overlapping each pass.

## 1. Getting Started: Setting Up Your Bissell Deep Clean Essential Complete

Before you begin, proper setup is crucial for a successful clean. First, unpack your Bissell Deep Clean Essential Complete and familiarize yourself with all the components. You’ll find the machine itself, a dirty water tank, a clean water tank, various cleaning tools, and potentially a sample of Bissell cleaning solution.  Always refer to your user manual for a complete parts list and specific instructions for your model.  Next, fill the clean water tank with warm tap water and the recommended amount of Bissell cleaning solution – using too much can leave residue.

*   **Important:** Only use Bissell cleaning solutions specifically designed for carpet cleaners. Other solutions could damage the machine.
*   Ensure the dirty water tank is securely locked into place.
*   Plug in the machine and ensure the power switch is off until you’re ready to start cleaning.

## 2. Understanding the Cleaning Modes and Attachments

The Bissell Deep Clean Essential Complete offers various cleaning modes to tackle different messes. Typically, you’ll find options like “Deep Clean” for heavily soiled areas and “Express Clean” for lighter cleaning.  Experiment with these modes to find what works best for your specific needs.  The machine also comes with a variety of attachments, each designed for a specific purpose. 

*   **Crevice Tool:** Perfect for getting into tight spaces and along baseboards.
*   **Stair Tool:** Ideal for cleaning stairs and upholstery.
*   **HydroRinse Self-Cleaning Hose:** This is great for spot cleaning and rinsing. You can learn more about spot cleaning with a [Bissell Spotbot](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-use-bissell-spotbot).
*   **Tough Stain Tool:** Designed for tackling stubborn stains.

## 3. The Cleaning Process: Step-by-Step Guide

Now for the main event! Begin by pre-treating any stubborn stains with a Bissell pre-treatment spray.  Then, select the appropriate cleaning mode and attachment for the surface you’re cleaning. Slowly and steadily push the machine forward, then pull it back, overlapping each pass slightly. This ensures complete coverage and prevents leaving streaks.  Avoid holding the machine in one spot for too long, as this can over-saturate the carpet.

*   **Tip:** Work in sections to maintain control and ensure you don’t miss any areas.
*   For carpets, a slow, deliberate pace is best for optimal cleaning.
*   Remember to empty and refill the dirty water tank as needed.

## 4. Cleaning Hard Floors with Your Bissell Deep Clean Essential Complete

While primarily designed for carpets, the Bissell Deep Clean Essential Complete can also be used on sealed hard floors.  However, it’s crucial to use the appropriate settings and attachments.  Switch to the hard floor setting, if available, and use the hard floor tool.  Use a cleaning solution specifically formulated for hard floors.  Avoid using excessive water, as this can damage some types of flooring.

*   Consider using a lower suction setting to prevent the machine from pulling up too much water.

## 5. Maintaining Your Bissell Deep Clean Essential Complete for Longevity

Regular maintenance is key to keeping your Bissell Deep Clean Essential Complete running smoothly. After each use, empty both the clean and dirty water tanks. Rinse the tanks thoroughly with clean water and allow them to air dry completely.  Remove and clean the brushes and filters regularly to prevent clogs and maintain suction power.  You can find detailed instructions on cleaning the filters in your user manual or by searching online for specific guides.  Proper maintenance will extend the life of your machine and ensure optimal performance.
