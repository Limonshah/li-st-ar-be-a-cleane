## Keeping Your Clothes Fresh: How To Clean A Maytag Bravos XL Washer

Is your laundry not smelling as fresh as it should? A dirty washing machine could be the culprit! Your Maytag Bravos XL washer, despite its robust design, needs regular cleaning to prevent mildew, detergent buildup, and unpleasant odors. This article will guide you through a comprehensive cleaning process, ensuring your clothes come out sparkling clean every time. We’ll cover everything from cleaning the dispenser to sanitizing the drum, keeping your machine in top condition.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning prevents odors and mildew.
*   Use washer cleaner monthly to maintain performance.
*   Wipe down the exterior regularly for a fresh look.
*   Clean the drain pump filter to avoid clogs.

**Quick Answer:** To clean a Maytag Bravos XL washer, run a cleaning cycle with washer cleaner, wipe down the dispenser and drum, clean the door seal, and check the drain pump filter monthly. This ensures optimal performance and prevents odors.

## Understanding Your Maytag Bravos XL Washer

The Maytag Bravos XL is a high-efficiency (HE) washer, meaning it uses less water than traditional top-load machines. This efficiency, however, also means it's more prone to buildup from HE detergents and fabric softener. Understanding this is the first step to properly maintaining your machine.  Regular cleaning is vital for preventing issues and extending the life of your appliance.  Let's dive into how to keep it running smoothly.

## Cleaning the Dispenser Drawer

The dispenser drawer is a prime location for detergent and fabric softener residue to accumulate. Over time, this buildup can harden and clog the dispenser, affecting your wash cycles.  Removing the drawer is usually simple – look for a release button or latch.  Once removed, soak the drawer in warm, soapy water for about 30 minutes.  Then, scrub away any residue with a soft brush.

## Deep Cleaning the Wash Drum

The wash drum needs regular attention to eliminate mildew and detergent residue.  Maytag recommends running a washer cleaning cycle with a washing machine cleaner. If your machine doesn’t have a dedicated cleaning cycle, select the hottest water setting and the largest load size. Add the recommended amount of washer cleaner (usually found on the cleaner’s packaging) directly into the drum.  Run a full cycle.  For extra sanitation, you can add a cup of white vinegar to the dispenser.  This helps to break down residue and deodorize the drum.

### Dealing with Stubborn Residue

Sometimes, a cleaning cycle isn’t enough to remove all the buildup. For stubborn residue, create a paste of baking soda and water. Apply this paste to the affected areas inside the drum and let it sit for 30 minutes. Then, scrub gently with a soft cloth or sponge. Avoid using abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the drum’s surface.

## Cleaning the Washer Door Seal & Exterior

The rubber door seal is a breeding ground for mold and mildew due to trapped moisture. After each wash, wipe down the seal with a dry cloth.  Periodically, spray the seal with a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar and let it sit for a few minutes before wiping clean.  Don't forget the exterior of your Maytag Bravos XL! Wipe down the control panel and sides with a damp cloth and mild detergent.  Keeping the exterior clean not only looks good but also prevents dust and grime from entering the machine.

## Maintaining the Drain Pump Filter

The drain pump filter catches lint, hair, and small objects to prevent them from clogging the drain pump.  A clogged filter can cause drainage issues and even damage the pump.  Locate the filter access panel (usually at the bottom front of the machine). Place a towel underneath to catch any water that may spill out. Carefully remove the filter and clean it thoroughly, removing any debris.  Refer to your owner’s manual for specific instructions on locating and removing the filter for your model.  Regularly checking this filter is a simple step that can save you from costly repairs.

## Preventing Future Buildup & Odors

Prevention is key to keeping your Maytag Bravos XL washer clean and fresh.  Here are a few tips:

*   **Use HE detergent:** Always use High Efficiency (HE) detergent, as regular detergents produce too many suds and can leave residue.
*   **Use the correct amount of detergent:**  Follow the detergent manufacturer’s instructions and avoid using too much.
*   **Leave the door ajar:** After each wash, leave the washer door slightly ajar to allow air circulation and prevent mildew growth.
*   **Run a cleaning cycle monthly:**  Make it a habit to run a cleaning cycle with washer cleaner at least once a month.
*   **Wipe down the seal after each use:** This simple step can significantly reduce mildew buildup.
