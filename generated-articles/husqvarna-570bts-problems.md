## Husqvarna 570bts Problems: A Comprehensive Troubleshooting Guide

Is your Husqvarna 570bts blower giving you trouble? Don't worry, you're not alone. This powerful blower is a favorite among homeowners and professionals, but like any engine, it can experience issues. This article will walk you through the most common Husqvarna 570bts problems, offering practical solutions to get you back to clearing leaves in no time. We’ll cover everything from starting difficulties to performance drops, ensuring you have the knowledge to maintain your blower effectively.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular maintenance is key to preventing problems.
*   Fuel issues are a common cause of starting and running problems.
*   Air filter clogs significantly reduce blower performance.
*   Spark plug issues can lead to misfires and engine failure.

The Husqvarna 570bts is known for its high blowing force, making it a great tool for yard cleanup. However, even the best equipment needs attention. Let's dive into the common problems and how to fix them.

### 1. Starting Problems with Your 570bts

A Husqvarna 570bts that won’t start is frustrating. Often, the issue isn’t a major mechanical failure, but a simple fix. One of the most frequent culprits is stale fuel. Gasoline degrades over time, especially when left sitting in the tank during the off-season. This can clog the carburetor and prevent the engine from starting.  You can avoid this by using a fuel stabilizer when storing the blower for extended periods.

Another common cause is a dirty air filter. A clogged air filter restricts airflow to the engine, making it difficult to start.  Check and clean or replace the air filter regularly.  If you're still having trouble, the spark plug might be the issue. A fouled or worn spark plug won’t ignite the fuel-air mixture. Replacing the spark plug is a relatively inexpensive and easy fix. For more complex starting issues, you might want to consult a professional, or review resources on [Husqvarna riding mower electrical problems](https://beacleaner.com/husqvarna-riding-mower-electrical-problems) for similar troubleshooting approaches.

### 2. Loss of Power and Performance

Has your Husqvarna 570bts lost its blowing power? A decrease in performance is often linked to a dirty air filter. As mentioned earlier, a clogged air filter restricts airflow, reducing the engine's efficiency. Regularly inspect and clean or replace the air filter to maintain optimal performance.  

Another potential cause is a partially blocked fuel filter. The fuel filter prevents debris from entering the carburetor. If it becomes clogged, it restricts fuel flow, leading to a loss of power.  Replacing the fuel filter is a simple maintenance task.  Finally, check the blower tube for obstructions. Leaves, twigs, or other debris can accumulate inside the tube, reducing airflow.

### 3. Fuel System Issues: Carburetor and Fuel Lines

The fuel system is crucial for the 570bts' operation. Problems here often manifest as starting difficulties or poor engine performance. A clogged carburetor is a common issue, especially if the blower has been stored with stale fuel. The carburetor mixes air and fuel, and any blockage prevents proper combustion. You can try cleaning the carburetor yourself, or take it to a qualified technician.  

Fuel lines can also become cracked or clogged over time. Inspect the fuel lines for any signs of damage or blockage. Replace any damaged fuel lines immediately.  Ensure the fuel cap vent is clear, as a blocked vent can create a vacuum in the fuel tank, restricting fuel flow.  If you're experiencing fuel-related issues with other Husqvarna equipment, exploring resources on [how to clean carburetor on Husqvarna riding lawn mower](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-carburetor-on-husqvarna-riding-lawn-mower) can provide helpful insights.

### 4. Overheating Problems

While less common, overheating can occur, especially during prolonged use. Overheating can damage the engine and lead to premature failure. Ensure the cooling fins on the engine are clean and free of debris. These fins dissipate heat, and any blockage reduces their effectiveness. 

Also, check the air filter. A clogged air filter restricts airflow, causing the engine to overheat.  Use the correct fuel-oil mixture, as an improper mixture can also contribute to overheating. If the blower continues to overheat, it's best to have it inspected by a qualified technician.

### 5. Vibration and Noise Issues

Excessive vibration or unusual noises can indicate a mechanical problem. Check the blower fan for damage or imbalance. A damaged or imbalanced fan can cause significant vibration.  Inspect the engine mounts for wear or damage. Worn or damaged engine mounts can allow the engine to vibrate excessively. 

Loose screws or bolts can also contribute to vibration and noise. Tighten any loose fasteners. If you hear a grinding or rattling noise, it could indicate a problem with the bearings.  Bearings may need to be replaced by a professional.

### 6.  Difficulties with the Throttle Control

Sometimes, the throttle control on the Husqvarna 570bts can become sticky or unresponsive. This can make it difficult to control the blower's speed.  The throttle cable might be frayed or binding. Inspect the throttle cable and lubricate it with a cable lubricant. 

The throttle lever itself might be dirty or corroded. Clean the throttle lever and ensure it moves freely. If the problem persists, the throttle linkage might be damaged and require replacement.  Understanding the intricacies of throttle controls can be beneficial; resources on [Husqvarna riding mower gas pedal not working](https://beacleaner.com/husqvarna-riding-mower-gas-pedal-not-working) might offer relevant insights.

### 7.  Spark Plug Fouling and Replacement

A fouled spark plug is a common cause of starting problems and poor engine performance. Spark plugs can become fouled with carbon buildup, oil, or fuel.  Inspect the spark plug regularly and clean or replace it as needed.  

When replacing the spark plug, ensure you use the correct type and gap. Using the wrong spark plug can damage the engine.  A properly functioning spark plug is essential for efficient combustion.  If you're consistently experiencing spark plug fouling, it could indicate a problem with the carburetor or fuel system.



## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How often should I clean the air filter on my Husqvarna 570bts?**
A: You should clean the air filter after every 5 hours of use, or more frequently in dusty conditions. A dirty air filter restricts airflow and reduces engine performance.

**Q: What type of fuel should I use in my Husqvarna 570bts?**
A: Use fresh, unleaded gasoline with an octane rating of 87 or higher. Always mix the fuel with a high-quality 2-stroke oil at the ratio recommended in your owner's manual.

**Q: How do I store my Husqvarna 570bts for the winter?**
A: Drain the fuel tank completely, or add a fuel stabilizer. Clean the air filter and spark plug. Store the blower in a dry, protected location.

**Q: What does it mean if my 570bts is smoking excessively?**
A: Excessive smoking can indicate a problem with the fuel mixture, a worn piston ring, or a damaged cylinder. It's best to have it inspected by a qualified technician.

**Q: Can I use ethanol-free fuel in my Husqvarna 570bts?**
A: Ethanol-free fuel is preferred, as ethanol can damage fuel lines and carburetors. If ethanol-free fuel isn't available, use fuel with a maximum of 10% ethanol.
