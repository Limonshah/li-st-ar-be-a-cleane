## Keeping Warm & Clean: How to Wash a Military Wool Blanket

Have you got a trusty military wool blanket that needs a refresh? These blankets are known for their incredible warmth and durability, but they do require special care. Washing a military wool blanket isn’t like tossing a fleece throw in the machine.  This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to safely and effectively clean your blanket, keeping it cozy for years to come. We’ll cover everything from pre-treatment to drying and storage, ensuring your blanket stays in top condition.

**Takeaway:**

*   Use cold water and a gentle detergent specifically designed for wool.
*   Avoid harsh agitation and high heat during washing and drying.
*   Proper drying is crucial to prevent shrinking and maintain the blanket’s shape.
*   Store your clean, dry blanket in a breathable container to prevent mildew.

**Quick Answer:** To wash a military wool blanket, use cold water and a wool-specific detergent on a gentle cycle. Avoid the dryer; instead, lay flat to air dry. This preserves the wool fibers and prevents shrinking.

## Understanding Your Military Wool Blanket

Before diving into the washing process, it’s important to understand what makes military wool blankets unique. These blankets are typically made from 80% wool and 20% synthetic fibers, designed to be incredibly resilient and warm even when wet.  However, this composition also means they require a delicate approach to cleaning. Unlike many modern blankets, these aren’t designed for frequent washing, and harsh treatment can damage the fibers. 

*   **Fiber Content:** Knowing the exact wool blend helps determine the best cleaning method.
*   **Construction:** Military blankets are tightly woven, which can make them heavy and slow to dry.
*   **Potential for Shrinkage:** Wool is prone to shrinking if exposed to high heat or agitation.

## Preparing Your Blanket for Washing

Proper preparation is key to a successful wash. Start by giving your blanket a thorough shake outdoors to remove loose dirt and debris.  Next, inspect the blanket for any rips, tears, or loose threads.  Addressing these issues *before* washing will prevent them from worsening during the cleaning process.

*   **Spot Cleaning:** Treat any visible stains with a wool-safe stain remover before washing. Gently blot the stain, avoiding rubbing, which can spread it.
*   **Pre-Soak (Optional):** For heavily soiled blankets, a brief pre-soak in cold water can help loosen dirt. Don’t soak for extended periods, as this can weaken the fibers.
*   **Check for Moth Damage:** Inspect for signs of moths and treat accordingly before washing.  You can find helpful tips on moth prevention at [https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-wool-jacket](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-wool-jacket).

## The Washing Process: Gentle is Key

Now for the main event!  The goal is to clean the blanket without damaging the wool fibers.  Always use cold water and a detergent specifically formulated for wool, like Woolite. Avoid using regular laundry detergent, as it can contain enzymes that break down wool fibers.  

*   **Washing Machine Settings:** Select the gentle or delicate cycle on your washing machine.
*   **Water Temperature:**  Cold water is crucial to prevent shrinking.
*   **Detergent Amount:** Use the amount of detergent recommended on the product label for wool items.  Less is often more.
*   **Avoid Agitation:**  Minimize agitation by avoiding overloading the washing machine.  Consider washing the blanket alone.  If your machine has a hand-wash cycle, that's an excellent option.
*   **Hand Washing Alternative:** For extra caution, you can hand wash the blanket in a large tub or basin. Gently submerge and squeeze the blanket, avoiding harsh rubbing.

## Drying Your Military Wool Blanket

This is arguably the most important step!  *Never* put a wool blanket in the dryer. The high heat will cause it to shrink and potentially felt.  Instead, focus on air drying.  

*   **Remove Excess Water:** Gently press out excess water – do *not* wring the blanket.
*   **Lay Flat to Dry:**  The best method is to lay the blanket flat on a clean, dry surface, such as a drying rack or a clean floor covered with towels.  Ensure good air circulation.
*   **Turn Regularly:** Flip the blanket periodically to ensure even drying.
*   **Drying Time:**  Drying can take several days, depending on the thickness of the blanket and the humidity levels.  Patience is key!
*   **Avoid Direct Sunlight:**  Direct sunlight can fade the color of the blanket.

## Storing Your Clean Military Wool Blanket

Once completely dry, proper storage will protect your blanket from moths and mildew.  Avoid storing the blanket in a plastic bag, as this can trap moisture and lead to mildew growth. 

*   **Breathable Storage:** Store the blanket in a breathable cotton or linen bag.
*   **Cedar Protection:**  Include cedar blocks or sachets in the storage bag to deter moths.  You can find more information on moth prevention at [https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-wool-sweater](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-wool-sweater).
*   **Cool, Dry Place:** Store the blanket in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated area.
*   **Avoid Compression:** Don’t tightly compress the blanket during storage, as this can damage the fibers.

## Addressing Specific Concerns & FAQs
