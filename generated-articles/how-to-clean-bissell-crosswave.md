## Keeping Your Floors Fresh: How to Clean a Bissell Crosswave

Is your Bissell Crosswave losing suction or leaving streaks? A little maintenance can go a long way in restoring its cleaning power. This guide will walk you through a complete cleaning process for your Bissell Crosswave, ensuring it continues to deliver spotless floors. We’ll cover everything from the brush roll to the dirty water tank, helping you maintain optimal performance. Let's dive in and get your Crosswave back to its best!

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly empty and clean both the clean and dirty water tanks.
*   Remove and clean the brush roll to eliminate hair and debris.
*   Wipe down the exterior of the machine and check for clogs.
*   Use Bissell cleaning solutions or a diluted vinegar solution for best results.

**Quick Answer:** To clean a Bissell Crosswave, empty and rinse both tanks, remove and clean the brush roll, and wipe down the machine's exterior. Regular cleaning prevents clogs and maintains optimal suction and cleaning performance.

## 1. Emptying and Cleaning the Water Tanks

The water tanks are the first place to start when cleaning your Bissell Crosswave. These tanks collect both the clean cleaning solution and the dirty water removed from your floors. Emptying them after each use prevents mold and mildew growth. Begin by removing both the clean and dirty water tanks from the machine. 

Next, rinse both tanks thoroughly with warm water. For the dirty water tank, you may need to use a mild dish soap to remove stubborn grime. Check the tanks for any buildup or residue and scrub gently with a soft brush if needed. Ensure all soap is rinsed away before reattaching the tanks to your Crosswave. For a deeper clean, consider using a diluted vinegar solution (1 part vinegar to 1 part water) in the dirty water tank to help disinfect and remove odors.

## 2. Removing and Cleaning the Brush Roll

The brush roll is the heart of your Bissell Crosswave’s cleaning power. Hair, fibers, and debris can easily wrap around it, reducing its effectiveness. To clean the brush roll, first, remove it from the machine – the process varies slightly depending on your Crosswave model, so consult your owner’s manual. 

Once removed, use scissors or a seam ripper to carefully cut away any tangled hair or fibers. You can also use your hands to pull away larger clumps. Inspect the brush roll for any damage, such as bent bristles. If you notice damage, consider replacing the brush roll for optimal performance. Finally, rinse the brush roll with warm water and allow it to air dry completely before reinstalling it. Maintaining a clean brush roll is crucial for effective floor cleaning, and you can learn more about cleaning different floor types with your Crosswave at [https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-area-rug-with-bissell-crosswave](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-area-rug-with-bissell-crosswave).

## 3. Cleaning the Filter

The filter in your Bissell Crosswave plays a vital role in trapping dirt and debris, preventing them from being recirculated onto your floors. A clogged filter reduces suction power and can even damage the machine. Locate the filter – it’s usually found in the dirty water tank area. 

Remove the filter and rinse it thoroughly under warm water. Gently squeeze out any excess water, but avoid twisting or wringing the filter, as this can damage it. Allow the filter to air dry completely before reinstalling it. Depending on your usage, you may need to replace the filter every few months. A clean filter ensures your Crosswave continues to deliver powerful suction and effective cleaning.

## 4. Wiping Down the Machine Exterior

Dust and grime can accumulate on the exterior of your Bissell Crosswave over time. Regularly wiping down the machine helps keep it looking its best and prevents buildup. Use a damp cloth with a mild cleaning solution to wipe down the body of the machine, the handle, and the wheels. 

Avoid using abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals, as these can damage the plastic. Pay attention to areas where dirt tends to accumulate, such as around the buttons and the tank compartments. Ensure the machine is unplugged before cleaning. A clean exterior not only looks better but also helps prevent the spread of germs.

## 5. Checking for and Removing Clogs

Clogs can significantly reduce the performance of your Bissell Crosswave. Regularly check for clogs in the hose, the spray nozzle, and the machine’s internal pathways. Disconnect the hose and inspect it for any blockages. 

You can use a long, flexible brush or a wire hanger to dislodge any clogs. Similarly, check the spray nozzle for obstructions. If you suspect a clog within the machine itself, consult your owner’s manual for instructions on how to safely access and clear it. Addressing clogs promptly ensures your Crosswave maintains optimal suction and cleaning power.

## 6. Deep Cleaning with Vinegar Solution

For a more thorough clean, consider using a diluted vinegar solution. Vinegar is a natural disinfectant and deodorizer that can help remove stubborn grime and odors. Mix equal parts white vinegar and warm water in the clean water tank. 

Run the Crosswave on a hard floor surface with the vinegar solution, then immediately run clean water through the machine several times to rinse away any remaining vinegar. This deep cleaning process helps sanitize the machine and leaves your floors smelling fresh. However, always check your owner’s manual to ensure vinegar is compatible with your specific Crosswave model.

## 7. Maintaining Your Bissell Crosswave: Preventative Measures

Preventative maintenance is key to keeping your Bissell Crosswave in top condition. Empty the water tanks after each use, and clean the brush roll regularly. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners. 

Store your Crosswave in a dry, clean place. Consider using a protective cover to prevent dust buildup. By following these simple preventative measures, you can extend the life of your machine and ensure it continues to deliver sparkling clean floors.
