## Briggs And Stratton Lawn Mower Won't Turn Off: A Comprehensive Guide

Have you ever finished mowing the lawn, flipped the switch, and been surprised – and a little alarmed – when your Briggs & Stratton lawn mower *didn’t* turn off? It’s a frustrating and potentially dangerous situation. A lawn mower that won’t shut down can waste fuel, overheat, and even pose a safety risk. This article will walk you through the most common reasons why your Briggs & Stratton lawn mower won’t turn off, and provide clear, step-by-step instructions to resolve the issue. We’ll cover everything from simple fixes to more complex troubleshooting, ensuring you can get back to enjoying your yard safely and efficiently.

**Takeaway:**

*   Check the engine switch and ensure it’s fully engaged.
*   Inspect the spark plug wire for damage or disconnection.
*   Clean or replace the carburetor if fuel is continuously flowing.
*   Consider a faulty automatic choke as a potential cause.
*   If unsure, consult a qualified repair technician.

**Quick Answer:**

A Briggs & Stratton lawn mower refusing to turn off usually stems from a problem with the engine switch, a stuck choke, a faulty carburetor allowing continuous fuel flow, or a disconnected spark plug wire. Always disconnect the spark plug wire first for safety before attempting any repairs.

## Understanding Why Your Mower Keeps Running

Before diving into solutions, it’s helpful to understand *why* a Briggs & Stratton lawn mower might continue running after you’ve attempted to turn it off. These engines rely on a precise balance of fuel, air, and spark. If any of these elements are disrupted, the engine may struggle to start or, in this case, shut down. Often, the issue isn’t a catastrophic failure, but a simple component malfunction. Understanding this can make the troubleshooting process less daunting.

## 1. The Engine Switch: Your First Check

The most common reason a Briggs & Stratton lawn mower won’t turn off is a problem with the engine switch itself. This switch is designed to interrupt the engine’s ignition system, stopping the flow of electricity to the spark plug. First, ensure the switch is fully engaged in the “off” position. Sometimes, the switch can feel like it’s off, but isn’t fully disconnecting the circuit. 

*   **Inspect the switch:** Look for any visible damage to the switch or its wiring.
*   **Test the connection:** If possible, use a multimeter to confirm the switch is actually breaking the circuit when in the “off” position.
*   **Consider replacement:** If the switch appears faulty, replacing it is a relatively inexpensive and straightforward repair. You can find replacement switches at most hardware stores or online. If you're unsure about electrical work, it's best to consult a professional.

## 2. Disconnecting the Spark Plug Wire: Immediate Safety

Regardless of the suspected cause, the *very first thing* you should do when a lawn mower won’t turn off is disconnect the spark plug wire. This immediately cuts off the ignition source, preventing the engine from continuing to run. Pull the wire firmly from the spark plug. This is a crucial safety step, preventing accidental starts while you work on the mower.

## 3. Carburetor Issues: Fuel Flow Problems

The carburetor mixes air and fuel to create the combustion that powers the engine. If the carburetor is dirty or malfunctioning, it can continue to deliver fuel to the engine even after you’ve turned off the switch. This can cause the engine to run on, especially if the choke is also stuck. 

*   **Check for fuel leaks:** Look for any signs of fuel leaking from the carburetor.
*   **Clean the carburetor:** A clogged carburetor is a common culprit. You can try cleaning it yourself using a carburetor cleaner, or consider professional cleaning.

*   **Inspect the float valve:** The float valve regulates fuel flow. If it’s stuck open, it will allow fuel to continuously enter the carburetor.

## 4. The Automatic Choke: A Common Suspect

The automatic choke helps start a cold engine by enriching the fuel mixture. However, if the choke is stuck in the closed position, it can continue to deliver excessive fuel, causing the engine to run on. 

*   **Visually inspect the choke:** Look for any obstructions preventing the choke from opening.
*   **Manually open the choke:** Try manually opening the choke plate to see if the engine slows down or stops.
*   **Lubricate the choke mechanism:** Sometimes, the choke mechanism can become sticky. Lubricating it with a light oil may resolve the issue.

## 5.  Fuel Shut-Off Valve: Ensuring No Fuel Flow

Many Briggs & Stratton lawn mowers have a fuel shut-off valve. This valve controls the flow of fuel from the fuel tank to the carburetor. If this valve is stuck open, it can contribute to the engine continuing to run. Locate the fuel shut-off valve (usually near the fuel tank) and ensure it’s in the “off” position.  If you've recently run out of gas, you might encounter starting issues.  See this article on [lawn mower won't start after running out of gas quick fixes](https://beacleaner.com/lawn-mower-wont-start-after-running-out-of-gas-quick-fixes) for related problems.

## 6.  Governor Issues: Maintaining Engine Speed

While less common, a malfunctioning governor can sometimes contribute to a lawn mower that won’t turn off. The governor regulates engine speed. If it’s stuck or damaged, it can prevent the engine from slowing down and stopping. This is a more complex issue that often requires professional diagnosis and repair. If you suspect a governor issue, it’s best to take your mower to a qualified technician.

## 7.  Old or Stale Fuel: A Preventative Measure

Using old or stale fuel can lead to various engine problems, including difficulty shutting off. Fuel degrades over time, forming deposits that can clog the carburetor and affect engine performance. Always use fresh fuel and consider adding a fuel stabilizer, especially if you’re storing the mower for an extended period.  Regular maintenance, like [how to clean the gas tank on a lawn mower](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-gas-tank-on-lawn-mower), can prevent fuel-related issues.
