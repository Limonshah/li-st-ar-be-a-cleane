## Keeping Relaxation Flowing: How To Clean Your Intex Hot Tub

Is your Intex hot tub looking a little less inviting? Don't worry, maintaining a clean and hygienic hot tub doesn’t have to be a chore. A regularly cleaned Intex hot tub ensures a relaxing and safe experience for everyone. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to keep your inflatable spa in top condition, from daily maintenance to deep cleaning. We’ll cover water chemistry, filter care, shell cleaning, and more, so you can spend less time cleaning and more time enjoying your hot tub.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly test and balance your water chemistry.
*   Clean or replace your filter as needed.
*   Wipe down the shell and inflateable surfaces frequently.
*   Drain and deep clean your hot tub every 3-6 months.

**Quick Answer:** Cleaning your Intex hot tub involves regular water testing and balancing, filter maintenance (cleaning or replacing), wiping down the shell, and a complete drain and deep clean every 3-6 months to prevent bacteria and algae growth.

## 1. Daily & Weekly Hot Tub Maintenance: A Simple Routine

Maintaining your Intex hot tub doesn’t require hours of work each day. A little bit of consistent effort goes a long way in preventing bigger cleaning tasks down the road. Start by checking the water level daily and adding water as needed to maintain the recommended level.  Also, visually inspect the water for clarity and any debris. 

Weekly, you should test the water chemistry using a test strip or liquid test kit. Proper water balance is crucial for sanitation and protecting the hot tub components.  Here’s what to check:

*   **pH:** Aim for 7.2 - 7.8.
*   **Alkalinity:** Keep between 80 - 120 ppm.
*   **Sanitizer (Chlorine or Bromine):** Maintain the recommended levels based on your chosen sanitizer.
*   Consider using a hot tub cover to protect the water from debris when not in use.  You can learn more about keeping your cover clean with our guide on [how to clean a hot tub cover](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hot-tub-cover).

## 2. The Heart of Clean: Cleaning Your Intex Hot Tub Filter

Your hot tub filter is the first line of defense against dirt and debris. A clean filter ensures clear water and efficient circulation.  How often you clean your filter depends on usage, but a good rule of thumb is to rinse it every 2-4 weeks.  

Here’s how to clean your Intex hot tub filter:

1.  Remove the filter from the hot tub.
2.  Rinse the filter pleats thoroughly with a garden hose, using a nozzle to get between the folds.
3.  For a deeper clean, you can soak the filter in a filter cleaning solution overnight.
4.  Allow the filter to dry completely before reinstalling. 

Over time, filters lose their effectiveness.  You should replace your filter every 12-18 months, or sooner if it becomes damaged.  For more detailed instructions, check out our guide on [how to clean hot tub filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hot-tub-filter).

## 3. Keeping the Shell Sparkling: Cleaning the Intex Hot Tub Surface

The shell of your Intex hot tub needs regular cleaning to remove oils, lotions, and other residues.  This prevents buildup and keeps the surface looking its best.  You can use a mild soap specifically designed for hot tubs, or a diluted solution of dish soap and water. 

Here’s how to clean the shell:

1.  Drain the hot tub.
2.  Mix your cleaning solution according to the product instructions.
3.  Apply the solution to the shell using a soft cloth or sponge.
4.  Scrub gently to remove any buildup.
5.  Rinse thoroughly with clean water.
6.  Dry the shell with a clean towel.

For stubborn stains, you might consider a specialized hot tub shell cleaner.  You can also find helpful tips on [how to clean hot tub shell](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hot-tub-shell).

## 4. Deep Cleaning: Draining and Sanitizing Your Intex Hot Tub

Every 3-6 months, you should completely drain and deep clean your Intex hot tub. This removes accumulated minerals, bacteria, and algae that can build up over time.  

Here’s how to deep clean your Intex hot tub:

1.  Drain the hot tub completely.
2.  Clean the filter as described in section 2.
3.  Clean the shell as described in section 3.
4.  Use a hot tub flush product to remove any remaining buildup from the plumbing lines.
5.  Refill the hot tub with fresh water and balance the chemistry.
6.  Consider using a non-foaming cleaner to remove any lingering residue.

If your hot tub has been sitting unused for a while, you might need to follow a slightly different process.  Our guide on [how to clean a drained hot tub](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-drained-hot-tub) can provide more specific instructions.

## 5. Dealing with Algae and Mold in Your Intex Hot Tub

Algae and mold can sometimes grow in hot tubs, especially if the water chemistry isn’t properly balanced.  Algae typically appears as a green or slimy residue, while mold can appear as black or white spots. 

To remove algae:

1.  Shock the hot tub with a non-chlorine shock.
2.  Run the filtration system continuously for 24-48 hours.
3.  Clean or replace the filter.

To remove mold:

1.  Drain the hot tub.
2.  Clean the shell with a mold and mildew remover specifically designed for hot tubs.
3.  Rinse thoroughly and refill the hot tub.

Preventing algae and mold is easier than removing it.  Maintaining proper water chemistry and regularly cleaning the filter are key.

## 6. Maintaining Intex Hot Tub Plumbing

The plumbing within your Intex hot tub can harbor bacteria and buildup over time. While not a frequent task, periodically cleaning the plumbing helps maintain water quality and prolong the life of your hot tub. 

Here's how to maintain your Intex Hot Tub plumbing:

1.  Use a hot tub plumbing cleaner after draining the tub.
2.  Follow the product instructions carefully.
3.  Run the hot tub for several hours after using the cleaner to flush the lines.
4.  Regularly clean the filter to prevent debris from entering the plumbing.
