## Keeping Your Head in the Game: How To Clean The Inside Of A Riddell Football Helmet

Ever wonder what’s brewing inside your football helmet? It’s likely a mix of sweat, dirt, and bacteria – not a pleasant thought! Cleaning the inside of your Riddell football helmet is crucial for hygiene, comfort, and even preventing skin issues. This guide will walk you through a simple, effective process to keep your helmet fresh and ready for the next game. We’ll cover everything from gathering supplies to drying your helmet properly. Let’s dive in and learn how to clean the inside of a Riddell football helmet, ensuring a safe and comfortable playing experience.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning prevents bacteria buildup.
*   Mild soap and water are the safest cleaning agents.
*   Proper drying is essential to avoid mold and mildew.
*   Disinfecting adds an extra layer of protection.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean the inside of a Riddell football helmet, remove the pads, wash them with mild soap and water, disinfect the shell, and allow everything to air dry completely before reassembling. This process eliminates odor-causing bacteria and ensures a hygienic playing environment.

## Why Cleaning Your Football Helmet Matters

Football is a physically demanding sport, and a lot of sweat ends up inside your helmet. This creates a breeding ground for bacteria, leading to unpleasant odors and potential skin irritations. Regularly cleaning your Riddell helmet isn’t just about comfort; it’s about health and safety. A clean helmet helps prevent the spread of infections and ensures you can focus on the game, not an itchy scalp.

## Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Before you start, make sure you have everything you need. You won’t need harsh chemicals or specialized tools.  Keeping it simple is best for protecting the helmet’s materials. Here’s a list of what you’ll need:

*   Mild dish soap or helmet cleaner
*   Warm water
*   Soft cloths or sponges
*   A bucket or sink
*   Disinfectant spray (optional, but recommended)
*   A clean, dry towel
*   A well-ventilated area for drying

## Removing and Washing the Helmet Pads

The pads are the biggest culprits when it comes to trapping sweat and bacteria. Carefully remove the pads from your Riddell helmet, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Most pads are held in place with Velcro or snaps.  Once removed, you can begin washing them.

1.  Fill a bucket or sink with warm water and a small amount of mild dish soap.
2.  Gently wash the pads, squeezing out excess water as you go. Avoid harsh scrubbing, which can damage the foam.
3.  Rinse the pads thoroughly with clean water until all the soap is gone.
4.  Allow the pads to air dry completely before putting them back in the helmet.  Don't use a dryer, as heat can damage the materials.

## Cleaning the Helmet Shell: Inside and Out

Now it’s time to tackle the helmet shell itself.  Even if the pads are clean, the inside of the shell can still harbor bacteria.  Start by wiping down the interior with a damp cloth.

1.  Mix a small amount of mild soap with warm water.
2.  Dip a soft cloth into the soapy water and wring it out well.
3.  Wipe down the entire inside of the helmet, paying attention to areas that come into direct contact with your head.
4.  Rinse the cloth with clean water and wipe away any soap residue.
5.  For extra protection, you can use a disinfectant spray specifically designed for sports equipment.  Follow the product’s instructions carefully.

## Disinfecting for Extra Protection

Disinfecting your helmet adds an extra layer of defense against bacteria and odors.  Choose a disinfectant spray that is safe for use on sports equipment and follow the instructions on the label. Spray the inside of the helmet thoroughly, ensuring you reach all areas. Allow the disinfectant to air dry completely before reassembling the helmet. This step is particularly important if the helmet is shared or if you’re prone to skin sensitivities.

## Drying Your Riddell Helmet Properly

Proper drying is crucial to prevent mold and mildew growth. Never use a hairdryer or other heat source to dry your helmet, as this can damage the materials. Instead, allow it to air dry completely in a well-ventilated area. 

*   Place the helmet in a shaded area, away from direct sunlight.
*   Ensure the pads are completely dry before reinserting them.
*   Leave the face mask open to allow for better airflow.
*   A fan can help speed up the drying process.

## Maintaining Helmet Hygiene Between Cleanings

While a thorough cleaning is important, you can also take steps to maintain helmet hygiene between cleanings.  Wiping down the inside of the helmet with a damp cloth after each use can help remove sweat and dirt. You can also use a helmet liner to absorb moisture and provide an extra layer of protection.  Consider also cleaning your [football gloves](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-smelly-football-gloves) to prevent the spread of bacteria.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

A: Sharing a football helmet is generally not recommended due to hygiene concerns. Bacteria and skin conditions can be easily spread. If you must share, ensure the helmet is thoroughly cleaned and disinfected before and after each use.
