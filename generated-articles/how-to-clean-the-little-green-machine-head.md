## Keeping Your Little Green Machine Fresh: A Guide to Cleaning the Head

Is your Bissell Little Green Machine not performing as well as it used to? Often, the culprit isn’t the machine itself, but a dirty cleaning head. A clogged or grime-covered head significantly reduces suction and cleaning power. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to thoroughly clean your Little Green Machine head, restoring its effectiveness and extending its lifespan. We’ll cover everything from quick rinses to deep cleaning procedures, ensuring your machine is always ready to tackle tough stains.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly rinse the head after each use.
*   Deep clean the head monthly (or more often with heavy use).
*   Disassemble and inspect for clogs.
*   Use warm, soapy water for cleaning.
*   Ensure all parts are completely dry before reassembly.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean your Little Green Machine head, remove it from the machine, rinse it thoroughly with warm water, and use a soft brush to remove any stubborn debris. For a deeper clean, soak it in warm, soapy water, then rinse and allow to air dry completely before reattaching.

## Why Cleaning the Little Green Machine Head Matters

The cleaning head is the workhorse of your Little Green Machine, directly responsible for scrubbing and lifting dirt and stains. Over time, it accumulates dirt, pet hair, cleaning solution residue, and other debris. This buildup restricts water flow and reduces the head’s ability to effectively agitate surfaces. A dirty head forces the machine to work harder, potentially shortening its lifespan. Regularly cleaning the head ensures optimal performance and prevents damage.

## Simple Rinse After Every Use

After each cleaning session, a quick rinse is crucial. This prevents buildup from hardening and becoming difficult to remove. Simply detach the head from the machine – it usually clicks off easily. Then, rinse it under warm running water, paying attention to the brush bristles and any crevices. This simple step can significantly extend the time between more thorough cleanings.

## Deep Cleaning Your Little Green Machine Head: A Step-by-Step Guide

For a more comprehensive clean, follow these steps. Start by detaching the head from the machine. Next, prepare a basin of warm water and a mild dish soap. Submerge the head in the soapy water and let it soak for about 15-30 minutes. This helps loosen stubborn dirt and grime. 

### Disassembling the Head for Thorough Cleaning

Some Little Green Machine heads can be partially disassembled for even deeper cleaning. Check your machine’s manual for specific instructions. Typically, you can remove the brush roll or brush plate. This allows you to access and clean areas that are otherwise difficult to reach. Inspect these parts closely for any tangled hair or debris.

### Scrubbing Away Stubborn Residue

After soaking, use a soft brush – an old toothbrush works perfectly – to scrub the head, paying close attention to the bristles and any hard-to-reach areas. For particularly stubborn residue, you can create a paste of baking soda and water and gently scrub with that. Avoid using abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the plastic components.

## Dealing with Clogs and Blockages

Clogs are a common issue with the Little Green Machine head. These can be caused by pet hair, fibers, or dried cleaning solution. Carefully inspect the spray nozzles and any small openings for blockages. Use a small pin or wire to gently clear any obstructions. Avoid forcing anything into the nozzles, as this could damage them. Regular inspection and clearing of clogs will maintain optimal suction.

## Drying and Reassembly: Preventing Mold and Mildew

Once you’ve thoroughly cleaned the head, it’s essential to dry it completely before reassembling. Moisture can lead to mold and mildew growth, which can be unpleasant and potentially harmful. Allow the head and any disassembled parts to air dry completely, preferably overnight. Ensure there is no visible moisture before reattaching the head to the machine.

## Maintaining Your Little Green Machine: Beyond the Head

Cleaning the head is just one part of maintaining your Little Green Machine. Regularly empty and clean the dirty water tank, and rinse the clean water tank after each use. Periodically check the hose for kinks or blockages. Following these simple maintenance steps will ensure your machine continues to deliver powerful cleaning performance for years to come.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
