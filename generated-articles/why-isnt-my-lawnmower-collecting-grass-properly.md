## Why Isn’t My Lawnmower Collecting Grass Properly?

Have you noticed unsightly clumps of grass left behind after mowing? It’s frustrating when your lawnmower isn’t collecting grass as it should, defeating the purpose of a tidy lawn. This issue is surprisingly common, and thankfully, often has a simple fix. In this article, we’ll explore the most frequent reasons why your lawnmower struggles with grass collection and provide practical solutions to get your mower working efficiently again. We’ll cover everything from blocked chutes to blade issues, ensuring you can enjoy a beautifully clean-cut lawn.

**Takeaway:**

*   Check for blockages in the grass collection chute and bag.
*   Ensure the grass bag is properly attached and not overfilled.
*   Sharpen or replace dull mower blades.
*   Adjust the cutting height for optimal grass collection.
*   Consider mowing when the grass is drier.

**A quick answer:** Your lawnmower isn’t collecting grass properly because of blockages, a full bag, dull blades, incorrect cutting height, or wet grass. Addressing these issues will restore efficient grass collection and a cleaner cut.

## 1. Blocked Grass Collection Chute & Bag

A blocked chute is the most common culprit when your lawnmower isn’t collecting grass. Grass clippings can easily build up inside the chute, restricting airflow and preventing the grass from reaching the bag. This is especially true when mowing long or damp grass.  Start by disconnecting the spark plug for safety before inspecting the chute.  Then, carefully remove any accumulated grass and debris. 

To prevent future blockages, consider mowing more frequently, especially during periods of rapid grass growth.  You can also try mowing in a different pattern to avoid repeatedly pushing large amounts of grass into the same area of the chute.  Regularly cleaning the chute after each use will also help maintain optimal performance. If you're dealing with stubborn debris, a long, flexible tool can be helpful.

## 2. Grass Bag Issues: Attachment & Overfilling

Even if the chute is clear, problems with the grass bag itself can prevent proper collection. First, ensure the bag is securely attached to the mower. A loose connection allows air to escape, reducing suction and causing grass to bypass the bag.  Double-check the clips or fasteners to confirm a tight seal. 

Overfilling the grass bag is another frequent issue. When the bag is too full, the clippings can’t flow freely, and the mower struggles to collect more. Empty the bag frequently, especially when mowing thick grass.  Consider investing in a larger capacity grass bag if you have a large lawn or consistently deal with heavy grass growth.

## 3. Dull or Damaged Mower Blades

Dull mower blades don’t cut the grass cleanly; instead, they tear it, creating longer clippings that are harder to collect. These torn clippings are more likely to clump together and block the chute. Sharp blades provide a clean cut, resulting in finer clippings that pack more efficiently into the grass bag. 

Inspect your mower blades regularly for dullness or damage. If the blades are dull, sharpen them using a blade sharpening tool or take them to a professional for sharpening. If the blades are bent or severely damaged, replace them immediately. Remember to disconnect the spark plug before working with the blades for safety.  Maintaining sharp blades also improves the overall health of your lawn.

## 4. Incorrect Cutting Height

The cutting height significantly impacts grass collection efficiency. If you’re mowing too low, the mower may struggle to lift and collect all the grass clippings. Conversely, if you’re mowing too high, the grass may not be cut cleanly, resulting in longer clippings that are difficult to manage. 

Adjust the cutting height to a setting that suits your grass type and growth rate. A general rule of thumb is to never remove more than one-third of the grass blade length at a time. Experiment with different heights to find the optimal setting for your lawn and mower.  Consider the season as well; you might raise the cutting height during hotter, drier periods.

## 5. Mowing Wet Grass

Mowing wet grass is a recipe for collection problems. Wet grass clumps together, making it difficult for the mower to pick up and bag. The moisture also adds weight to the clippings, increasing the likelihood of blockages.  Plus, wet grass can damage your lawn, leading to uneven cuts and potential disease.

Whenever possible, wait until the grass is dry before mowing. If you must mow damp grass, raise the cutting height and mow at a slower pace. You may also need to empty the grass bag more frequently.

## 6. Airflow Issues & Mower Deck Design

Sometimes, the problem isn’t with the clippings themselves, but with the mower’s airflow.  The design of the mower deck plays a crucial role in creating the suction needed to lift and collect grass.  If the deck is damaged or has gaps, airflow can be compromised. 

Inspect the mower deck for any signs of damage, such as cracks or dents. Ensure all panels are securely fastened.  Also, check the air intake vents to make sure they are clear of debris.  Some mower designs are simply more efficient at collecting grass than others. If you consistently struggle with collection, you might consider upgrading to a model with a more effective deck design.

## 7.  Mower Maintenance & Air Filter

Regular mower maintenance is essential for optimal performance, including efficient grass collection. A dirty air filter restricts airflow to the engine, reducing its power and affecting the mower’s ability to create sufficient suction.  A clogged air filter can also lead to other engine problems.

Check the air filter regularly and clean or replace it as needed. Refer to your mower’s owner’s manual for specific instructions on air filter maintenance.  Additionally, ensure the engine is properly tuned and that the spark plug is in good condition.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Why does my lawnmower leave clumps of grass even after cleaning the chute?**
A: Clumps can still occur if your blades are dull, you’re mowing wet grass, or the cutting height is too low. Ensure your blades are sharp, the grass is dry, and the cutting height is appropriate for your grass type.

**Q: How often should I sharpen my lawnmower blades?**
A:  Generally, you should sharpen your blades every 25 hours of use, or at least once a year.  However, this can vary depending on your lawn conditions and how often you mow.

**Q: Can I use my lawnmower to collect leaves?**
A: While some lawnmowers can handle light leaf collection, they are primarily designed for grass clippings.  Using a dedicated leaf blower or vacuum is more effective for collecting leaves.

**Q: What should I do if my grass bag keeps falling off?**
A: Check the attachment mechanism for damage or wear. Ensure the bag is properly secured and that the clips or fasteners are functioning correctly. You may need to replace the bag or the attachment hardware.

**Q: Is mulching a good alternative to grass collection?**
A: Yes, mulching is an excellent alternative. It finely chops the grass clippings and returns them to the lawn as fertilizer. This can improve soil health and reduce the need for chemical fertilizers.



## Conclusion

A lawnmower that isn’t collecting grass properly can be a real headache, but the good news is that the solution is often straightforward. By addressing common issues like blocked chutes, full bags, dull blades, and incorrect cutting heights, you can restore your mower’s efficiency and enjoy a beautifully manicured lawn.
