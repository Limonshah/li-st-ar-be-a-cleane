## Briggs & Stratton Lawn Mower Starts Then Dies: Troubleshooting Guide

Is your weekend getting ruined by a lawn mower that refuses to cooperate? It’s incredibly frustrating when your Briggs & Stratton lawn mower starts up with promise, only to die shortly after. This is a common issue, and thankfully, often a fix you can tackle yourself. This article will walk you through the most likely causes of this problem, and provide clear steps to get your mower back to its best. We’ll cover everything from simple fuel issues to more complex carburetor problems.

**Takeaway:**

*   Check the fuel supply and quality.
*   Clean or replace the air filter.
*   Inspect and clean the carburetor.
*   Ensure the spark plug is clean and functioning.
*   Verify the safety switches are working correctly.

**Quick Answer:** A Briggs & Stratton lawn mower starting then dying usually indicates a fuel delivery problem, a dirty carburetor, or an issue with the air intake. Checking the fuel, air filter, and carburetor are the first steps to resolving this issue.

## 1. Fuel Issues: The Most Common Culprit

Often, a Briggs & Stratton lawn mower that starts and then dies is suffering from a fuel-related problem. Old or contaminated fuel is a frequent offender. Gasoline degrades over time, especially when left sitting in the mower during the off-season. This degraded fuel can clog the fuel lines and carburetor, preventing a consistent fuel supply.  Always use fresh gasoline, and consider adding a fuel stabilizer if you plan to store the mower for an extended period. 

Another issue could be a clogged fuel filter. This small but important component prevents debris from reaching the carburetor. A blocked filter restricts fuel flow, causing the engine to stall.  You can easily replace a fuel filter – they are inexpensive and readily available.

## 2. A Dirty Air Filter: Restricting Airflow

Your lawn mower engine needs a proper air-fuel mixture to run correctly. A dirty air filter restricts airflow, disrupting this balance. When the air filter is clogged with grass clippings, dust, and debris, the engine struggles to breathe. This can cause it to start, run briefly, and then stall.  

Regularly inspecting and cleaning (or replacing) the air filter is crucial for maintaining optimal performance.  Most air filters are easily accessible and can be cleaned with compressed air or replaced with a new one.  Don't underestimate the importance of a clean air filter; it's a simple maintenance task that can save you a lot of headaches.

## 3. Carburetor Problems: The Heart of the Fuel System

The carburetor mixes air and fuel to create the combustible mixture that powers your engine. If your Briggs & Stratton lawn mower starts then dies, a dirty or clogged carburetor is a prime suspect.  Over time, fuel can leave behind deposits and varnish inside the carburetor, restricting fuel flow and causing it to malfunction. 

Symptoms of a carburetor issue include a rough idle, stalling, and difficulty starting. Cleaning the carburetor can often resolve these problems. This involves disassembling the carburetor, cleaning the jets and passages with carburetor cleaner, and reassembling it.  If you're not comfortable tackling this yourself, it's best to consult a qualified mechanic.

### 3.1 Carburetor Cleaning Without Removal

Sometimes, you can address minor carburetor issues without complete disassembly. Using a carburetor cleaner spray, you can attempt to clear blockages through the jets and passages. This is a less invasive approach, but it may not be effective for severe clogs.  It's a good first step before considering a full carburetor cleaning.

## 4. Spark Plug Issues: Ignition Problems

A faulty spark plug can also cause your lawn mower to start and then die. The spark plug ignites the air-fuel mixture, and if it's worn, fouled, or damaged, it won't produce a strong enough spark. This results in an incomplete combustion, causing the engine to stall. 

Inspect the spark plug for signs of wear, carbon buildup, or damage. Clean the spark plug with a wire brush or replace it with a new one.  Ensure the spark plug gap is set correctly according to your mower's specifications.  A properly functioning spark plug is essential for reliable engine operation.

## 5. Safety Switch Malfunctions: Preventing Operation

Briggs & Stratton lawn mowers are equipped with safety switches designed to prevent operation under unsafe conditions. These switches are located on the handle, blade engagement lever, and sometimes the seat (on riding mowers). If a safety switch is faulty or not fully engaged, it can interrupt the engine's operation, causing it to stall. 

Check all safety switches to ensure they are functioning correctly. Make sure the handle is fully engaged and the blade engagement lever is in the correct position. If a switch appears to be faulty, it may need to be replaced.

## 6. Low Oil Shut-Off: Protecting the Engine

Briggs & Stratton engines have a low oil shut-off feature that prevents the engine from running if the oil level is too low. This protects the engine from damage. If the oil level is low, the engine may start briefly and then die. Check the oil level and add oil if necessary. Always use the correct type of oil recommended for your mower.

## 7. Overheating: A Less Common Cause

While less common, overheating can also cause a Briggs & Stratton lawn mower to start and then die. Overheating can be caused by a clogged cooling fan, restricted airflow, or a malfunctioning cooling system. If the engine overheats, it may shut down to prevent damage. Allow the engine to cool down before attempting to restart it.

## FAQ: Common Questions About Briggs & Stratton Mowers

**Q: Why does my lawn mower start then immediately die?**
A: This often points to a fuel delivery issue, like old gas or a clogged fuel filter. A quick check of your fuel and filter can often resolve the problem.

**Q: Can a dirty carburetor cause a lawn mower to die after starting?**
A: Absolutely. A dirty carburetor restricts fuel flow, leading to stalling shortly after starting. Cleaning the carburetor is a common solution.

**Q: How often should I change the air filter on my Briggs & Stratton mower?**
A: It depends on usage, but generally, you should check it before each mowing season and replace it if it's dirty.

**Q: What does the low oil shut-off do?**
A: The low oil shut-off prevents the engine from running if the oil level is too low, protecting it from damage.



## Conclusion

A Briggs & Stratton lawn mower that starts and then dies is a frustrating problem, but it’s often solvable with a little troubleshooting. By systematically checking the fuel system, air filter, carburetor, spark plug, and safety switches, you can identify the cause and get your mower running smoothly again. Remember to prioritize safety and consult a qualified mechanic if you're uncomfortable performing any repairs yourself.  Keeping your lawn mower well-maintained will save you time, money, and frustration in the long run.
