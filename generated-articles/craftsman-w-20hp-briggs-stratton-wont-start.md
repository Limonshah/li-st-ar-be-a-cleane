## Craftsman W 20hp Briggs Stratton Won't Start: A Troubleshooting Guide

Is your Craftsman W 20hp lawn mower giving you trouble and refusing to start? It’s a frustrating situation, especially when you have yard work to tackle. A Briggs & Stratton 20hp engine is generally reliable, but like any small engine, it can experience issues that prevent it from starting. This article will walk you through the most common reasons why your Craftsman mower won’t start and provide step-by-step instructions to get it running again. We’ll cover everything from simple fixes to more involved troubleshooting.

**Takeaway:**

*   Check the fuel system for old gas or a clogged fuel filter.
*   Inspect the spark plug for fouling or damage.
*   Ensure the safety switches are functioning correctly.
*   Verify the engine has compression.

**Quick Answer:** A Craftsman W 20hp Briggs Stratton mower that won’t start often stems from fuel issues, a faulty spark plug, or a problem with the safety switches. Regularly maintaining your mower and addressing issues promptly can prevent these frustrating no-start situations.

## 1. Fuel System Issues: The Most Common Culprit

Often, a lawn mower that won’t start has a problem with its fuel system. Old or stale gasoline is a frequent offender. Gasoline degrades over time, especially when left sitting in the tank over the winter. This degraded fuel can clog the carburetor and prevent the engine from receiving the fuel it needs to run.  Start by draining the old fuel from the tank and replacing it with fresh gasoline. You might also consider adding a fuel stabilizer to prevent future degradation.

Another common issue is a clogged fuel filter. The fuel filter prevents debris from entering the carburetor. If it becomes clogged, it restricts fuel flow. Locate the fuel filter (usually in the fuel line between the tank and the carburetor) and replace it with a new one.  If you suspect a severely clogged carburetor, you may need to clean it.  You can find detailed instructions on [how to clean a Briggs and Stratton carburetor](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-briggs-and-stratton-carburetor) online.

## 2. Spark Plug Problems: No Spark, No Start

If the fuel system seems fine, the next thing to check is the spark plug. The spark plug ignites the air-fuel mixture, creating the combustion that powers the engine. A fouled, cracked, or otherwise damaged spark plug won’t produce a spark, and the engine won’t start.  Remove the spark plug and visually inspect it. Look for signs of carbon buildup, cracking, or damage to the electrode. 

Clean a fouled spark plug with a wire brush, or replace it with a new one.  Ensure the spark plug gap is set to the manufacturer's specifications (usually around 0.030 inches).  To test if the spark plug is receiving power, reconnect it to the spark plug wire and ground the metal body of the plug against the engine block. Pull the starter cord – you should see a bright blue spark. If not, the issue may lie with the ignition coil.

## 3. Safety Switch Malfunctions: Preventing Accidental Starts

Craftsman lawn mowers are equipped with several safety switches designed to prevent accidental starts. These switches include the operator presence switch (OPS) on the seat, the blade engagement switch, and the parking brake switch. If any of these switches are faulty, they can prevent the engine from starting, even if everything else is working correctly.

Test each switch individually. For the OPS, ensure you are firmly seated on the seat while attempting to start the mower. For the blade engagement switch, make sure the blade is disengaged.  For the parking brake switch, ensure the parking brake is engaged. If you suspect a faulty switch, you may need to replace it.  Sometimes, simply cleaning the contacts of the switch can resolve the issue.

## 4. Checking the Engine Compression: A Critical Component

Engine compression is essential for the combustion process. Without sufficient compression, the air-fuel mixture won’t ignite properly.  Checking compression requires a compression tester, which you can rent from many auto parts stores. Remove the spark plug and screw the compression tester into the spark plug hole. Pull the starter cord several times and record the reading on the tester.

A healthy Briggs & Stratton 20hp engine should have a compression reading of at least 90 PSI. If the reading is significantly lower, it indicates a problem with the piston rings, valves, or cylinder head.  Low compression often requires professional repair.  If you're experiencing issues with your mower's engine running rough, it could be related to compression issues, similar to a [Briggs and Stratton V-Twin running on one cylinder](https://beacleaner.com/briggs-and-stratton-v-twin-running-on-one-cylinder).

## 5. Air Filter Inspection: Ensuring Proper Airflow

A dirty or clogged air filter restricts airflow to the engine, which can cause starting problems and reduce performance. Remove the air filter and inspect it. If it’s dirty, clean it by tapping it gently to remove loose debris. If it’s heavily soiled or damaged, replace it with a new one. A clean air filter ensures the engine receives the proper amount of air for efficient combustion.

## 6. Battery and Starter Issues: For Electric Start Models

If your Craftsman mower has an electric start, a weak or dead battery can prevent it from starting. Check the battery voltage with a voltmeter. It should read at least 12.6 volts. If the voltage is low, charge the battery or replace it. Also, inspect the battery terminals for corrosion and clean them if necessary.  If the battery is good, but the starter still doesn’t engage, the starter motor or solenoid may be faulty.  If you've recently replaced the battery and are still having trouble, check out [Craftsman riding mower won't start with new battery](https://beacleaner.com/craftsman-riding-mower-wont-start-with-new-battery) for more troubleshooting tips.

## 7. Addressing Carburetor Issues: Beyond Simple Cleaning

Sometimes, a simple carburetor cleaning isn’t enough.  If you’ve cleaned the carburetor and your mower still won’t start, there may be a more significant issue, such as a damaged float, a clogged jet, or a faulty needle valve. These repairs often require specialized tools and knowledge.  If you’re not comfortable tackling these repairs yourself, it’s best to take your mower to a qualified small engine mechanic.



## FAQ: Common Questions About Craftsman Mower Starting Problems

**Q: Why won't my Craftsman mower start after sitting all winter?**
A:  Sitting for extended periods can cause fuel to degrade and clog the carburetor. Drain the old fuel, replace the fuel filter, and consider cleaning the carburetor.  You may also need to check the spark plug and battery (if equipped).  Refer to [Why won't my lawn mower start after winter](https://beacleaner.com/why-wont-my-lawn-mower-start-after-winter) for more detailed guidance.

**Q: What does it mean if my mower turns over but won't start?**
A: This usually indicates a lack of spark, fuel, or compression. Check the spark plug, fuel system (filter, lines, carburetor), and compression as outlined above.

**Q: Can I use starting fluid to help my mower start?**
A: While starting fluid can temporarily help, it’s not a long-term solution. It masks the underlying problem and can potentially damage the engine if used excessively. If your mower only starts with starting fluid, you need to diagnose and fix the root cause.  See [Engine starts with starter fluid but won't stay running](https://beacleaner.com/engine-starts-with-starter-fluid-but-wont-stay-running) for more information.

**Q: How often should I replace the spark plug on my Craftsman mower?**
A:  Generally, you should replace the spark plug every 100 hours of operation or annually, whichever comes first.



## Conclusion

Getting your Craftsman W 20hp Briggs Stratton mower started again doesn’t have to be a daunting task. By systematically troubleshooting the fuel system, spark plug, safety switches, and compression, you can often identify and resolve the issue yourself. Remember to prioritize safety and consult a qualified mechanic if you’re uncomfortable performing any of these repairs.  Regular maintenance, including fresh fuel, a clean air filter, and a properly functioning spark plug, will help prevent future starting problems and keep your mower running smoothly for years to come. Don't let a no-start situation ruin your weekend – get back to enjoying your yard!
