## Revitalize Your Fur: How To Clean A Fur Coat That Smells

Is your cherished fur coat carrying an unwanted scent? Don't worry, you're not alone! Many fur owners face this issue, often caused by storage, perfume, or simply absorbing environmental odors. This article will guide you through effective methods to clean a fur coat that smells, restoring its luxurious feel and fresh scent. We’ll cover everything from simple airing-out techniques to more involved cleaning processes, ensuring your fur remains beautiful for years to come. Let's get started on bringing life back to your favorite coat!

**Takeaway:**

*   Air out your fur regularly.
*   Use gentle brushing to remove dust and debris.
*   Spot clean with a fur-specific cleaner if needed.
*   Consider professional cleaning for deep odor removal.
*   Store your fur properly to prevent future odors.

**Quick Answer:** To clean a fur coat that smells, start by airing it out in a well-ventilated area. Gently brush the fur to remove dust, and spot clean any visible stains with a fur-specific cleaner. For stubborn odors, professional cleaning is recommended.

## Understanding Why Your Fur Coat Smells

Before diving into cleaning, it’s helpful to understand *why* your fur coat might be smelling. Furs are natural fibers, and they readily absorb odors from their surroundings. This can include mothballs (a common storage method), perfume, cigarette smoke, or even food smells.  Sometimes, the smell isn't the fur itself, but the leather underneath that's retaining odors.  Proper storage and regular maintenance are key to preventing these issues.  Ignoring the smell can lead to more significant problems, potentially attracting moths or causing the fur to deteriorate.

## The First Step: Airing Out Your Fur Coat

Often, a simple airing-out is all your fur coat needs.  This is the least invasive method and can effectively remove mild odors. Hang your fur coat on a sturdy, padded hanger in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight. Direct sunlight can damage the fur and cause fading.  Leave it hanging for at least 24-48 hours, allowing fresh air to circulate and neutralize the odors.  If you live in a humid climate, a dehumidifier can help speed up the process.  

## Gentle Brushing: Removing Dust and Surface Odors

Brushing your fur coat regularly is crucial for maintenance and odor control. Use a soft-bristled brush specifically designed for fur – a brush with widely spaced bristles is best. Gently brush the fur in the direction of the nap, removing dust, dirt, and debris that may be trapping odors.  Avoid brushing against the nap, as this can damage the fur.  This simple step can significantly freshen up your coat and prevent odors from becoming ingrained.

## Spot Cleaning: Addressing Localized Odors and Stains

If airing and brushing aren’t enough, you may need to spot clean.  However, *never* use water or harsh chemicals on your fur.  Instead, invest in a fur-specific cleaner. These cleaners are formulated to be gentle on the fur and leather while effectively removing stains and odors.  Test the cleaner on an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t cause discoloration. Apply a small amount of cleaner to a clean cloth and gently blot the affected area. Avoid rubbing, as this can damage the fur.  Allow the area to air dry completely.

### Choosing the Right Fur Cleaner

Selecting the right cleaner is paramount. Look for products specifically labeled for fur, and avoid those containing harsh chemicals like bleach or ammonia.  Read reviews and consider the type of fur you have – different furs may require different cleaning solutions.  A reputable furrier can also recommend a suitable cleaner for your specific coat.

## Deep Cleaning: When to Call a Professional

For stubborn odors or heavily soiled fur, professional cleaning is the best option.  A professional furrier has the expertise and specialized equipment to clean your coat safely and effectively. They can remove deep-seated odors, restore the fur’s luster, and ensure it’s properly conditioned.  While it's an investment, professional cleaning can significantly extend the life of your fur coat.  Don't attempt to deep clean your fur yourself, as you risk damaging it irreparably.

## Proper Fur Storage: Preventing Future Odors

Preventing odors is easier than removing them. Proper storage is key to keeping your fur coat fresh and odor-free.  Never store your fur in plastic, as this can trap moisture and lead to mildew. Instead, use a breathable garment bag made of cotton or muslin.  Store your fur in a cool, dark, and dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat.  Avoid storing it in a cedar closet, as cedar oil can damage the fur.  Consider using a fur protector spray to repel moths and prevent odors.  

## FAQ: Common Questions About Cleaning Smelly Fur Coats

**Q: Can I use baking soda to deodorize my fur coat?**

A: While baking soda is effective for deodorizing many fabrics, it's generally not recommended for fur. The fine particles can get trapped in the fur and be difficult to remove, potentially causing damage.

**Q: How often should I have my fur coat professionally cleaned?**

A:  Generally, you should have your fur coat professionally cleaned every 1-3 years, depending on how often you wear it and the conditions it's exposed to.

**Q: What if my fur coat smells like mothballs?**

A: Mothballs are a common culprit for unpleasant odors. Airing out the coat for an extended period (several days to a week) can help dissipate the smell. If the odor persists, professional cleaning is recommended.

**Q: Can perfume cause my fur coat to smell?**

A: Yes, perfume can definitely be absorbed by the fur and contribute to an unpleasant odor over time. Avoid spraying perfume directly onto your fur coat.
