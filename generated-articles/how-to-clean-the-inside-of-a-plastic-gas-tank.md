## Cleaning Your Plastic Gas Tank: A Step-by-Step Guide

Is your vehicle running rough, or are you noticing decreased fuel efficiency? A dirty gas tank could be the culprit. Over time, sediment, rust, and old fuel residue can accumulate inside, hindering performance. This article will walk you through how to clean the inside of a plastic gas tank safely and effectively, restoring your fuel system to optimal condition. We’ll cover everything from necessary tools to step-by-step instructions, ensuring a smooth process.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly cleaning your plastic gas tank prevents fuel contamination.
*   Using the right tools and techniques ensures safety and effectiveness.
*   A clean gas tank improves fuel efficiency and engine performance.

**What's the quickest way to clean the inside of a plastic gas tank?**

The fastest way involves draining the old fuel, rinsing with a fuel tank cleaner, and thoroughly flushing with fresh gasoline. Always prioritize safety by disconnecting the battery and working in a well-ventilated area.

## Why Clean Your Plastic Gas Tank?

You might be wondering if cleaning your gas tank is truly necessary. The answer is often yes! Even plastic gas tanks aren’t immune to buildup. Old fuel can leave behind varnish and gum, while rust from metal components (like the fuel pump or sending unit) can contaminate the tank. This contamination can clog fuel filters, damage fuel injectors, and ultimately lead to poor engine performance.  Keeping your tank clean is preventative maintenance that can save you money on costly repairs down the road.

## Tools and Materials You’ll Need

Before you begin, gather the necessary tools and materials. Having everything on hand will make the process much smoother and safer. Here’s a checklist:

*   **Fuel Tank Cleaner:** Choose a cleaner specifically designed for plastic fuel tanks.
*   **Drain Pan:** To safely collect the old fuel.
*   **Funnel:** For adding cleaner and fresh fuel.
*   **Siphon Pump or Drain Plug Wrench:** Depending on your tank’s access.
*   **Protective Gear:** Gloves, safety glasses, and a respirator are essential.
*   **Fresh Gasoline:** For flushing the tank after cleaning.
*   **Clean Rags:** For wiping up spills.
*   **Bright Flashlight:** To inspect the tank's interior.

## Safely Draining the Old Fuel

Safety is paramount when working with gasoline. Begin by disconnecting the negative terminal of your vehicle’s battery to prevent sparks. Work outdoors or in a very well-ventilated area.  Carefully siphon the old fuel from the tank into a designated fuel-safe drain pan.  Dispose of the old fuel properly at a hazardous waste collection facility – never pour it down the drain or onto the ground.  If your tank has a drain plug, use the appropriate wrench to carefully open it and drain the fuel.

## Using a Fuel Tank Cleaner

Now that the tank is empty, it’s time to introduce a fuel tank cleaner.  Follow the manufacturer’s instructions on the cleaner bottle carefully. Typically, you’ll pour the recommended amount of cleaner into the tank through the fuel filler neck using a funnel.  Gently rock the vehicle (or carefully rotate the tank if it’s removed) to ensure the cleaner coats all interior surfaces. Allow the cleaner to sit for the recommended time – usually several hours or overnight – to dissolve sediment and varnish.  This step is crucial for breaking down the buildup.

## Flushing the Tank with Fresh Gasoline

After the cleaner has had sufficient time to work, it’s time to flush the tank with fresh gasoline. Add several gallons of clean gasoline to the tank and gently rock the vehicle to agitate the mixture.  Then, drain the gasoline into a clean drain pan. Repeat this process several times until the gasoline comes out clear and free of debris. This ensures all traces of the cleaner and loosened sediment are removed.

## Inspecting and Finalizing the Cleaning Process

Once you’ve flushed the tank, use a bright flashlight to inspect the interior. Look for any remaining sediment or varnish. If you find any, repeat the cleaning process with fresh cleaner and gasoline.  Once you’re satisfied with the cleanliness, reinstall the fuel pump and sending unit (if removed).  Reconnect the fuel lines and ensure all connections are secure. Finally, reconnect the vehicle’s battery and add fresh gasoline to the tank.  Start the engine and let it run for a few minutes to ensure everything is functioning properly.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can I use vinegar to clean my plastic gas tank?**

A: While vinegar can dissolve some deposits, it’s not recommended for plastic gas tanks. It can potentially damage certain plastic components and doesn’t effectively remove all types of fuel residue. Dedicated fuel tank cleaners are a safer and more effective option.

**Q: How often should I clean my plastic gas tank?**

A:  The frequency depends on your driving habits and fuel quality. Generally, cleaning every 2-3 years is a good practice. If you notice performance issues or suspect fuel contamination, clean it sooner.

**Q: Is it safe to clean a gas tank myself?**

A: Yes, but safety precautions are crucial. Always disconnect the battery, work in a well-ventilated area, wear protective gear, and dispose of old fuel properly.

**Q: What if I can't remove the gas tank from my vehicle?**

A: You can still clean the tank without removing it, but it may be more challenging to reach all areas. Use a siphon pump and carefully rock the vehicle to ensure the cleaner reaches all surfaces.



## Conclusion

Cleaning the inside of a plastic gas tank is a valuable maintenance task that can improve your vehicle’s performance and fuel efficiency. By following these steps and prioritizing safety, you can effectively remove sediment and restore your fuel system to optimal condition. Remember to use a dedicated fuel tank cleaner, flush thoroughly with fresh gasoline, and inspect the tank for any remaining debris.
