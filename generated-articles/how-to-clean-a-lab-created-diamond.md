## Keeping Your Sparkle: How To Clean A Lab Created Diamond

Do you want to ensure your lab created diamond maintains its dazzling brilliance?  Lab created diamonds, while incredibly durable, still attract dirt, oils, and lotions that can diminish their sparkle.  This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about cleaning your lab grown diamond at home, keeping it looking as stunning as the day you got it. We’ll cover daily maintenance, deep cleaning methods, and what to avoid to protect your investment. Let's dive in and learn how to keep your diamond shining!

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning (weekly) with mild soap and water maintains brilliance.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive materials.
*   Professional cleaning is recommended annually.
*   Proper storage prevents buildup of dirt and grime.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean a lab created diamond, soak it in warm water with dish soap for 20-30 minutes, gently scrub with a soft toothbrush, rinse thoroughly, and dry with a lint-free cloth. This simple process removes dirt and oils, restoring your diamond’s sparkle.

## Understanding Lab Created Diamonds & Cleaning Needs

Lab created diamonds are physically, chemically, and optically identical to mined diamonds. This means they have the same hardness and brilliance, and therefore, similar cleaning requirements. However, because they are often more affordable, many people wear them more frequently, increasing the need for regular cleaning. Daily wear exposes your diamond to oils from your skin, residue from lotions, and everyday grime.  Keeping your diamond clean isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about maximizing its light performance. A clean diamond reflects light more effectively, resulting in greater fire and scintillation.

## Daily & Weekly Maintenance for a Sparkling Stone

Consistent, gentle care is the best way to keep your lab created diamond looking its best.  You can easily incorporate a few simple habits into your routine. After wearing your diamond jewelry, wipe it down with a soft, lint-free cloth. This removes surface oils and prevents buildup.  For a more thorough weekly clean, use a mild dish soap and warm water.  

Here’s a simple weekly cleaning routine:

*   Fill a small bowl with warm water.
*   Add a few drops of mild dish soap (avoid soaps with moisturizers).
*   Soak your diamond jewelry for 20-30 minutes.
*   Gently scrub with a soft-bristled toothbrush, paying attention to the setting.
*   Rinse thoroughly under warm running water.
*   Dry with a lint-free cloth.

## Deep Cleaning Your Lab Created Diamond

While regular maintenance keeps your diamond looking good, a deep clean is necessary a few times a year to remove stubborn grime.  This is especially important if you’ve been swimming, gardening, or engaging in activities that expose your jewelry to harsh elements.  For a deeper clean, you can use a commercial jewelry cleaner specifically designed for diamonds.  However, always read the instructions carefully and ensure it’s safe for your setting.  If you're unsure, stick to the mild soap and water method.  You can also consider an ultrasonic cleaner, but use caution and avoid using it if your diamond has any fractures or inclusions.  If you have a [diamond bracelet](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-diamond-bracelet), a deep clean is particularly important to reach all the intricate settings.

## What To Avoid When Cleaning Your Diamond

Certain cleaning methods can actually damage your lab created diamond or its setting.  Avoid harsh chemicals like chlorine bleach, ammonia, and acetone. These can corrode the metal and potentially damage the diamond.  Never use abrasive cleaners like baking soda or toothpaste, as they can scratch the diamond’s surface.  Also, avoid using hot water, as sudden temperature changes can cause the setting to loosen.  Finally, be careful with ultrasonic cleaners, especially if your diamond has any imperfections.  Protecting your investment means knowing what *not* to do.

## Cleaning Different Diamond Settings

The setting of your lab created diamond requires special consideration during cleaning.  Prong settings, for example, can trap dirt and debris underneath.  Use a soft brush to carefully clean under the prongs, ensuring no buildup remains.  For channel settings, a soft brush and warm soapy water are usually sufficient.  If you have a [diamond tennis bracelet](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-diamond-tennis-bracelet), pay extra attention to the delicate channel settings.  Bezel settings are generally easier to clean, as they fully encircle the diamond, but still require gentle scrubbing with a soft brush.  Always inspect the setting after cleaning to ensure no stones are loose.

## Professional Cleaning & Inspection

While you can effectively clean your lab created diamond at home, it’s still recommended to have it professionally cleaned and inspected annually. A jeweler can use specialized equipment to remove stubborn grime and check for any loose prongs or damage to the setting.  They can also polish the diamond to restore its brilliance.  Professional cleaning isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about ensuring the long-term security and beauty of your jewelry.  Think of it as preventative maintenance for a valuable piece.
