## Revlon Brush Dryer Cleaning: A Simple Guide

Is your Revlon brush dryer losing its oomph? Don't worry, it happens! Hair, dust, and product buildup can significantly impact its performance. Cleaning your Revlon brush dryer regularly isn’t just about maintaining its effectiveness; it extends its lifespan too. This article will walk you through a step-by-step process to get your brush dryer back to its best, ensuring smooth, shiny hair every time. Let’s dive in and learn how to properly clean your Revlon brush dryer.

**Takeaway:**

*   Unplug the dryer and let it cool completely.
*   Remove the lint trap and clean it after *every* use.
*   Use a soft brush to remove hair from the bristles.
*   Wipe down the barrel with a damp cloth.
*   Ensure the dryer is completely dry before using it again.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean your Revlon brush dryer, unplug it and let it cool. Remove the lint trap, then gently brush away hair from the bristles. Wipe the barrel with a damp cloth and ensure it’s fully dry before reuse.

## Why Cleaning Your Revlon Brush Dryer Matters

Regular cleaning is essential for maintaining the performance of your Revlon brush dryer. Think of it like this: a clogged dryer doesn’t heat efficiently, and a hair-filled brush doesn’t style effectively.  Buildup restricts airflow, causing the dryer to overheat and potentially damage your hair. Plus, a clean dryer simply *works* better, giving you the smooth, salon-quality results you expect.  Don't let hair and product residue hinder your styling routine!

## Cleaning the Lint Trap: Your First Step

The lint trap is the first place you should focus your cleaning efforts. This component catches loose hair and debris, preventing it from circulating within the dryer.  Cleaning the lint trap *after every use* is the single most important thing you can do to maintain your Revlon brush dryer.  Simply remove the lint trap (usually located at the base of the handle) and discard the collected lint.  For a deeper clean, you can wash the lint trap with mild soap and water, ensuring it’s completely dry before reinserting it.

## Removing Hair From the Bristles

Hair wrapped around the bristles is a common issue with brush dryers.  Don't pull or yank, as this can damage the bristles. Instead, use a cleaning tool, like a pick or a small comb, to gently loosen and remove the hair.  You can also use your fingers, but be patient and work slowly.  For stubborn hair, consider using a pair of small scissors to carefully snip away tangled strands.  Removing hair regularly ensures even heat distribution and prevents the brush from becoming ineffective.

## Cleaning the Barrel of Your Revlon Dryer

The barrel of your Revlon brush dryer can accumulate dust, product residue, and even more hair.  Start by unplugging the dryer and allowing it to cool completely.  Then, dampen a soft cloth with water (or a mild cleaning solution) and gently wipe down the barrel. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the finish.  Pay attention to any areas with visible buildup.  For hard-to-reach spots, you can use a cotton swab.  Remember to wipe away any excess moisture with a dry cloth.

### Dealing with Stubborn Product Buildup

Sometimes, water alone isn’t enough to remove stubborn product buildup.  In these cases, you can try a mixture of warm water and a small amount of mild dish soap.  Dip a cloth into the solution, wring it out thoroughly, and gently wipe the barrel.  Be sure to rinse the barrel with a clean, damp cloth to remove any soap residue.  Avoid getting water inside the dryer’s housing.  If you're dealing with a particularly sticky residue, let the soapy water sit for a few minutes before wiping it away.

## Cleaning the Air Intake Vent

The air intake vent is often overlooked, but it's crucial for maintaining optimal performance.  This vent draws air into the dryer, and if it's clogged with dust and hair, it can cause the dryer to overheat.  Locate the air intake vent (usually on the back of the dryer) and use a soft brush or a vacuum cleaner attachment to remove any visible debris.  Be gentle to avoid damaging the vent.  Regularly cleaning the air intake vent will help ensure your dryer runs efficiently and safely.

## Drying and Storage: Final Steps

After cleaning, it’s vital to ensure your Revlon brush dryer is completely dry before using it.  Wipe down all surfaces with a clean, dry cloth.  Allow the dryer to air dry for at least 30 minutes to ensure no moisture remains inside.  Store your dryer in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures.  Proper storage will help protect it from damage and prolong its lifespan.  Consider storing it in a dust bag to prevent buildup between cleanings.
