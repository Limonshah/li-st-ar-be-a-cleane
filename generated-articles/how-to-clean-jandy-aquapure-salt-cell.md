## Keeping Your Pool Sparkling: How To Clean A Jandy Aquapure Salt Cell

Is your saltwater pool not as clean as it used to be? A dirty Jandy Aquapure salt cell could be the culprit. Salt cells are the heart of a saltwater pool system, converting salt into chlorine to sanitize your water. Over time, calcium and other minerals can build up on the cell plates, reducing its efficiency. This guide will walk you through how to clean your Jandy Aquapure salt cell, ensuring a crystal-clear pool all season long. We’ll cover everything from recognizing when cleaning is needed to the step-by-step process and preventative measures.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning maximizes your salt cell’s efficiency.
*   Inspect your cell every 3-6 months for scale buildup.
*   A mild acid solution is typically the most effective cleaning method.
*   Proper maintenance extends the life of your Jandy Aquapure salt cell.

**What does it mean to clean a Jandy Aquapure salt cell?**

Cleaning a Jandy Aquapure salt cell involves removing calcium scale and other mineral deposits that accumulate on the cell plates. This buildup reduces the cell’s ability to efficiently generate chlorine, impacting your pool’s sanitation. A clean cell operates more effectively, saving energy and extending its lifespan.

## 1. Recognizing When Your Jandy Aquapure Salt Cell Needs Cleaning

Don't wait for a cloudy pool to tell you something is wrong. Several signs indicate your Jandy Aquapure salt cell needs attention. One common indicator is a low chlorine output, even with proper salt levels. You might notice your pool requires more manual chlorine additions than usual. Another sign is the system displaying an error code related to low chlorine production or cell performance. Visually inspecting the cell itself can also reveal scale buildup, appearing as white or grayish deposits on the plates. 

Regular inspection, every 3-6 months, is key. [https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-salt-pool-cell](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-salt-pool-cell) provides a more detailed look at recognizing the signs of a dirty salt cell.

## 2. Gathering Your Supplies for Jandy Aquapure Salt Cell Cleaning

Before you begin, gather everything you’ll need. Safety is paramount, so start with protective gear: rubber gloves and eye protection. You’ll need a bucket large enough to submerge the salt cell. A muriatic acid solution is the most common cleaning agent; typically a 5:1 water to acid ratio is recommended, but *always* follow the manufacturer’s instructions on the acid container. A soft brush, like a toothbrush or nylon brush, is essential for gently scrubbing the cell plates. Finally, have a garden hose available for rinsing.

Avoid using metal brushes or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the cell plates. Remember to work in a well-ventilated area when handling muriatic acid.

## 3. Removing the Jandy Aquapure Salt Cell

Turning off the power to your pool system is the first and most important step. Locate the breaker switch for the pump and salt system and switch it off. Next, close the valves on either side of the salt cell to prevent water from flowing through it. Carefully disconnect the cell from the plumbing, noting the direction of water flow for reinstallation. Disconnect the electrical connections, again taking note of the wiring configuration. 

Once disconnected, carefully remove the cell and place it in the bucket. It’s a good idea to take a picture of the wiring before disconnecting it to ensure correct reassembly.

## 4. The Cleaning Process: Using a Mild Acid Solution

Now for the core of the process. Carefully pour the prepared muriatic acid solution into the bucket, ensuring the salt cell is fully submerged. Allow the cell to soak for 15-20 minutes, depending on the severity of the scale buildup. Do not exceed 30 minutes, as prolonged exposure can damage the cell. After soaking, gently scrub the cell plates with the soft brush, removing any remaining scale. 

Avoid excessive force, as the plates are delicate. Rinse the cell thoroughly with the garden hose, ensuring all traces of acid are removed. [https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-jandy-salt-cell](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-jandy-salt-cell) offers a visual guide to this process.

## 5. Inspecting and Reinstalling Your Cleaned Jandy Aquapure Salt Cell

After rinsing, carefully inspect the cell plates. They should be clean and free of visible scale. If any scale remains, repeat the soaking and scrubbing process. Before reinstalling, double-check all connections and ensure they are clean and dry. Reconnect the electrical wiring, referring to your earlier photo if needed. Reconnect the plumbing, ensuring the cell is installed in the correct direction of water flow. 

Finally, slowly open the valves and turn the power back on to your pool system. Monitor the system for any leaks or unusual behavior.

## 6. Preventing Future Buildup on Your Salt Cell

Cleaning your Jandy Aquapure salt cell is important, but preventing buildup is even better. Maintaining proper water chemistry is crucial. Regularly test and adjust your pool’s pH, alkalinity, and calcium hardness levels. High calcium hardness is a major contributor to scale formation. Consider using a scale inhibitor, which helps prevent mineral deposits from forming on the cell plates. 

Additionally, ensure your salt level is within the recommended range for your Jandy Aquapure system. [https://www.beacleaner.com/how-often-to-clean-pentair-salt-cell](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-often-to-clean-pentair-salt-cell) discusses preventative measures for all types of salt cells.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues After Cleaning

Sometimes, even after cleaning, you might encounter issues. If your salt cell isn’t producing chlorine, double-check the electrical connections and ensure the cell is properly aligned in the flow path. Verify your salt level is correct. If the problem persists, the cell may be damaged and require replacement. Another common issue is a “low flow” error. This indicates insufficient water flow through the cell, which can be caused by a clogged filter or a malfunctioning pump.

If you're unsure about any step, consult a qualified pool professional.



## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How often should I clean my Jandy Aquapure salt cell?**
A: Generally, you should inspect your salt cell every 3-6 months and clean it as needed. The frequency depends on your water hardness and pool usage. If you notice reduced chlorine output or scale buildup, it’s time for a cleaning.

**Q: Can I use vinegar to clean my Jandy Aquapure salt cell?**
A: While vinegar can remove some scale, it’s not as effective as a mild muriatic acid solution for significant buildup. Vinegar may also require a much longer soaking time and may not fully dissolve the calcium deposits.

**Q: Is it safe to handle muriatic acid?**
A: Muriatic acid is corrosive and requires careful handling. Always wear rubber gloves and eye protection, work in a well-ventilated area, and *always* add acid to water, never water to acid.

**Q: What if my Jandy Aquapure salt cell is severely damaged?**
A: If your salt cell is cracked, corroded, or shows significant damage, it likely needs to be replaced. Continuing to use a damaged cell can be unsafe and ineffective.

**Q: Can I clean my Jandy Aquapure salt cell with a pressure washer?**
A: No, do not use a pressure washer to clean your salt cell. The high pressure can damage the delicate cell plates and void your warranty.



## Conclusion

Cleaning your Jandy Aquapure salt cell is a vital part of maintaining a healthy and sparkling pool. By following these steps, you can ensure optimal performance, extend the life of your cell, and enjoy a worry-free swimming season. Remember to prioritize safety when handling chemicals and to regularly inspect your cell for signs of buildup. A little preventative maintenance goes a long way in keeping your saltwater pool system running smoothly. Don’t hesitate to consult a pool professional if you encounter any difficulties. Keeping your Jandy Aquapure salt cell clean is an investment in the longevity and enjoyment of your pool.
