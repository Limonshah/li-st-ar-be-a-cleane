## How To Clean Your LG Washer Filter: A Step-by-Step Guide

Is your LG washing machine leaving clothes wetter than usual, taking longer to drain, or even displaying error codes? A clogged filter is often the culprit. Cleaning your LG washer filter is a simple maintenance task that can save you from costly repairs and keep your laundry routine running smoothly. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about cleaning your LG washer filter, ensuring optimal performance.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly cleaning your LG washer filter (every 1-3 months) prevents clogs.
*   A clogged filter can lead to poor washing performance and potential damage.
*   The process is straightforward and requires minimal tools.

**What does the LG washer filter do?**

The LG washer filter is designed to catch lint, hair, coins, and other small objects that can slip through your laundry. This prevents these items from damaging the drain pump and ensures efficient water drainage. Keeping this filter clean is crucial for the longevity and effectiveness of your washing machine.

## Why Cleaning Your LG Washer Filter Matters

Ignoring your LG washer filter can lead to a host of problems. A clogged filter restricts water flow, meaning your clothes won’t get thoroughly rinsed. This can leave detergent residue on your garments, causing skin irritation or affecting fabric quality.  Furthermore, the pump has to work harder to push water through the blockage, potentially leading to overheating and eventual failure.  Regular cleaning is a preventative measure that protects your investment.

## Locating the LG Washer Filter

The location of the filter varies slightly depending on your LG washer model. However, it’s typically found at the bottom front of the machine, behind a small access panel.  

Here’s how to find it:

1.  **Unplug the Washer:** Safety first! Always disconnect the power supply before attempting any maintenance.
2.  **Locate the Access Panel:** Look for a small door or panel near the bottom right or left corner of the front of your washer.
3.  **Prepare for Water:** Place a shallow pan or towel under the access panel to catch any water that may spill out when you remove the filter.
4.  **Open the Panel:** Gently pry open the access panel.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning the Filter

Now that you’ve located the filter, let’s get to cleaning! This process is straightforward, but attention to detail is key.

1.  **Slowly Open the Filter Cap:** Turn the filter cap counterclockwise. Be prepared for water to drain out – this is normal.  Turn slowly to control the flow.
2.  **Remove the Filter:** Once the water flow slows to a trickle, carefully pull the filter straight out.
3.  **Clean the Filter:** Rinse the filter under warm running water. Use your fingers or a soft brush to remove any lint, hair, coins, or other debris.  For stubborn buildup, you can soak the filter in warm, soapy water for a few minutes.
4.  **Inspect the Filter Housing:** While the filter is removed, shine a flashlight into the filter housing and check for any remaining debris. Remove anything you find.  You can also use a damp cloth to wipe down the inside of the housing.
5.  **Reinstall the Filter:**  Insert the cleaned filter back into the housing, ensuring it’s fully seated.
6.  **Close the Filter Cap:** Turn the filter cap clockwise until it’s snug. Do not overtighten.
7.  **Close the Access Panel:** Securely close the access panel.
8.  **Plug in the Washer:** Reconnect the power supply.

## Dealing with a Stubbornly Clogged Filter

Sometimes, the filter is more than just a little dirty. If you encounter a severely clogged filter, here are a few tips:

*   **Soak in Vinegar:** Soak the filter in a solution of equal parts white vinegar and water for 30 minutes to help dissolve mineral deposits and loosen stubborn debris.
*   **Use a Toothbrush:** A soft-bristled toothbrush can be helpful for scrubbing away stubborn lint and hair.
*   **Check the Drain Pump:** If the filter is clear but your washer still isn’t draining properly, the drain pump itself may be clogged. This is a more complex repair and may require professional assistance.
*   **Preventative Measures:** Consider using laundry bags for delicate items and emptying pockets before washing to reduce the amount of debris that ends up in the filter.

## How Often Should You Clean the LG Washer Filter?

Ideally, you should clean your LG washer filter every 1-3 months, depending on how frequently you do laundry and the types of items you wash. If you wash a lot of heavily soiled clothes or have pets, you may need to clean the filter more often.  Pay attention to your washer’s performance – if you notice slower draining or error codes, it’s a good indication that the filter needs cleaning.  Regular maintenance, like cleaning the filter, is much cheaper than a repair.

## Troubleshooting: LG Washer Error Codes Related to Filter

Certain error codes on your LG washer may indicate a problem with the filter or drain pump. Here are a few common ones:

*   **OE (Out of Balance) or UE (Unbalanced Load):** While not always directly related to the filter, a clogged filter can contribute to an unbalanced load.
*   **DE (Drain Error):** This code specifically indicates a problem with draining, which is often caused by a clogged filter.
*   **LE (Low Water Level):** A clogged filter can restrict water flow, leading to a low water level error.

If you encounter any of these error codes, cleaning the filter should be your first step. If the error persists, consult your LG washer’s user manual or contact a qualified appliance repair technician.
