## Sparkling Clean: How to Clean Pots With Baking Soda

Is your kitchen filled with pots and pans bearing the scars of delicious meals – and stubborn, burnt-on food? Don't worry, you're not alone! Learning [how to clean pots with baking soda](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-pots-with-baking-soda) is a simple, affordable, and eco-friendly solution. This article will walk you through everything you need to know to restore your cookware to its former glory, using the power of this kitchen staple. We’ll cover tackling burnt messes, removing stains, and keeping your pots looking their best.

**Takeaway:**

*   Baking soda is a gentle abrasive, perfect for cleaning pots without scratching.
*   Combining baking soda with water creates a powerful cleaning paste.
*   For tough messes, boiling a baking soda solution directly in the pot works wonders.
*   Regular cleaning with baking soda prevents buildup and makes future cleaning easier.

**Quick Answer:** To clean pots with baking soda, make a paste of baking soda and water, apply it to the pot, let it sit, then scrub gently. For burnt food, boil a solution of baking soda and water in the pot before scrubbing.

## Why Baking Soda is Your Pot-Cleaning Superhero

Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, isn’t just for baking! It’s a fantastic natural cleaner with mild abrasive properties. This means it can gently scrub away grime and food residue without damaging your pots and pans. It’s also a deodorizer, helping to eliminate lingering smells from cooking. Plus, it’s a much safer and more environmentally friendly option than harsh chemical cleaners. You likely already have some in your pantry, making it a convenient and cost-effective cleaning solution.

## Dealing with Burnt-On Food: The Boiling Method

Burnt food can seem impossible to remove, but don’t reach for the steel wool just yet! Boiling water with baking soda is a surprisingly effective method. First, fill the pot with enough water to cover the burnt areas. Then, add 2-3 tablespoons of baking soda to the water. Bring the mixture to a boil and let it simmer for 15-30 minutes. This will loosen the burnt food, making it much easier to scrub away with a non-abrasive sponge. If you have a particularly stubborn mess, you can let the solution sit overnight before scrubbing.

## Creating a Powerful Baking Soda Paste for Scrubbing

For everyday cleaning and less severe burnt-on food, a baking soda paste is your best friend. Simply mix baking soda with a small amount of water to create a thick paste. The consistency should be similar to toothpaste. Apply the paste to the affected areas of the pot and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. Then, using a non-abrasive sponge or cloth, gently scrub the surface. Rinse thoroughly with water. This method is great for stainless steel, enamel, and even [cleaning aluminum pots](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-aluminum-pots).

## Cleaning Different Types of Pots with Baking Soda

Not all pots are created equal, and some require a little extra care. Here’s how to adapt the baking soda cleaning method for different materials:

*   **Stainless Steel:** Baking soda is excellent for stainless steel. It won’t scratch the surface and effectively removes food residue and water stains.
*   **Non-Stick:** Be extra gentle with non-stick surfaces. Use a soft sponge and avoid abrasive scrubbing to prevent damaging the coating.
*   **Cast Iron:** While baking soda can be used on cast iron, use it sparingly. Excessive use can remove the seasoning. Always re-season your cast iron pot after cleaning with baking soda.
*   **Enamel:** Baking soda is generally safe for enamel, but avoid using it on chipped or cracked enamel, as it can worsen the damage.
*   **Copper:** Baking soda can help restore the shine to copper pots. After cleaning, polish with a soft cloth.

## Tackling Stubborn Stains and Discoloration

Sometimes, it’s not burnt food but stubborn stains that plague your pots. Baking soda can help with these too! For water stains or discoloration, make a paste of baking soda and lemon juice. The acidity of the lemon juice boosts the cleaning power of the baking soda. Apply the paste to the stains, let it sit for 30 minutes, and then scrub gently. Rinse thoroughly. You can also use this method to brighten up dull stainless steel.

## Preventing Future Messes: Regular Maintenance

The best way to keep your pots clean is to prevent messes from building up in the first place. After each use, rinse your pots with warm water and a mild dish soap. For pots that have held sticky or starchy foods, soak them in warm water with a tablespoon of baking soda before washing. This will help loosen any residue and make cleaning easier. Regular maintenance will save you time and effort in the long run.
