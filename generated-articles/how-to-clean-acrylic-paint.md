## How to Clean Acrylic Paint: A Complete Guide

Ever splattered acrylic paint where you shouldn’t? Don’t worry, it happens to the best of us! Cleaning up acrylic paint can seem daunting, but with the right techniques, it’s surprisingly manageable. This article will walk you through everything you need to know about **how to clean acrylic paint** from brushes, clothing, surfaces, and more. We’ll cover quick fixes, preventative measures, and the best products to use for a spotless result. Let’s dive in and get your space looking fresh again!

**Takeaway:**

*   Clean brushes immediately with water and soap.
*   Use rubbing alcohol for dried paint on surfaces.
*   Act fast when paint gets on clothing – don't let it dry!
*   Prevention is key: protect surfaces and wear appropriate clothing.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean acrylic paint, start by removing as much wet paint as possible. For brushes, rinse thoroughly with water and use soap. Dried paint often responds to rubbing alcohol or specialized acrylic paint removers. Always test any cleaning solution in an inconspicuous area first.

## Cleaning Wet Acrylic Paint: Immediate Action

When acrylic paint is still wet, cleanup is significantly easier. The key is to act fast and prevent the paint from drying and bonding to the surface. Don't delay; the longer you wait, the harder it becomes to remove the paint. Start by gently scraping off any excess paint with a plastic scraper or a dull knife. Avoid using metal tools, as they can scratch the surface. 

Next, dampen a clean cloth or sponge with warm water. Gently blot the wet paint, working from the outside in to prevent spreading. For brushes, rinse them under running water, gently massaging the bristles to release the paint.  Remember to thoroughly clean your [how-to-clean-a-paint-can](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-paint-can) after use to prevent build-up.  Avoid hot water, as it can set the paint.

## Tackling Dried Acrylic Paint on Surfaces

Dried acrylic paint presents a bigger challenge, but it’s still manageable. The most effective method often involves rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol).  It works by softening the paint, making it easier to lift. Begin by testing the alcohol in an inconspicuous area to ensure it doesn’t damage the surface. 

Once you’ve confirmed it’s safe, apply a small amount of rubbing alcohol to a clean cloth. Gently rub the dried paint in a circular motion.  You may need to apply several times and let the alcohol sit for a few minutes to fully soften the paint. For stubborn spots, you can try a plastic scraper to gently lift the softened paint.

### Different Surfaces, Different Approaches

The best approach for removing dried acrylic paint varies depending on the surface:

*   **Glass & Tile:** Rubbing alcohol is usually very effective.
*   **Wood:** Test alcohol carefully. You might need a specialized acrylic paint remover.
*   **Plastic:** Alcohol can sometimes damage plastic, so test first. Mild soap and water may be sufficient.
*   **Metal:** Rubbing alcohol or a gentle abrasive cleaner can work well.

## Cleaning Acrylic Paint from Brushes: Preservation is Key

Proper brush cleaning is crucial for extending the life of your tools. Acrylic paint dries quickly, so immediate attention is vital. Rinse the brush under lukewarm water, removing as much paint as possible. Then, apply a small amount of mild soap (dish soap works well) to the bristles. 

Gently massage the bristles to create a lather, working the soap deep into the base of the brush. Rinse thoroughly until the water runs clear. Reshape the bristles and allow the brush to dry flat or with the bristles pointing downwards.  Never store brushes with the bristles up, as this can cause water to seep into the ferrule and loosen the bristles.  For a deeper clean, consider using a brush cleaner specifically designed for acrylic paints.

## Removing Acrylic Paint from Clothing & Fabric

Getting acrylic paint on clothing is a common mishap. The key is to act quickly! If the paint is still wet, immediately blot (don't rub!) the area with a clean cloth or paper towel. Rinse the back of the fabric with cold water to help push the paint out.

If the paint has dried, you’ll need to be more persistent. Try soaking the affected area in rubbing alcohol for 30 minutes. Then, gently scrub with a soft brush or cloth. For delicate fabrics, test the alcohol in an inconspicuous area first.  If the stain persists, you may need to use a commercial stain remover specifically designed for acrylic paint.  Avoid using heat (like a dryer) until the stain is completely removed, as heat can set the stain permanently.

## Dealing with Acrylic Paint on Acrylic Surfaces

Cleaning acrylic paint from acrylic surfaces, like a sink or tub, requires a gentle approach to avoid scratching. Start by trying warm, soapy water. If that doesn’t work, move on to rubbing alcohol, testing it in a hidden spot first. 

For tougher stains, consider using a specialized acrylic cleaner. Avoid abrasive cleaners, as they can dull the surface.  If you have a black acrylic sink, you might find our guide on [how-to-clean-a-black-acrylic-sink](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-black-acrylic-sink) particularly helpful.  Always rinse thoroughly after cleaning.

*   **Protect Surfaces:** Cover work areas with drop cloths, newspaper, or plastic sheeting.
*   **Wear Appropriate Clothing:** Wear old clothes or an apron to protect your garments.
*   **Use a Palette:** Use a palette to control the amount of paint you use.
*   **Clean Up Spills Immediately:** Don’t let spills sit and dry.
*   **Proper Storage:** Store paints tightly sealed to prevent drying and accidental spills.
