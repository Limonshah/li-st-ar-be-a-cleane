## How To Clean Lexan Windows: A Complete Guide

Have you noticed streaks or grime clouding your Lexan windows? Lexan, also known as polycarbonate, is a fantastic material for windows due to its impact resistance and clarity. However, it *does* require specific cleaning techniques to avoid scratches and maintain its pristine condition. This article will walk you through everything you need to know about cleaning Lexan windows effectively and safely. We’ll cover the best cleaning solutions, tools, and preventative measures to keep your windows looking their best.

**Takeaway:**

*   Use a mild soap and water solution.
*   Avoid abrasive cleaners and scrub brushes.
*   Rinse thoroughly with clean water.
*   Dry with a soft, microfiber cloth.
*   Protect Lexan from harsh chemicals and direct sunlight.

**Quick Answer:** To clean Lexan windows, mix a few drops of dish soap with warm water. Gently wash the surface with a soft cloth, rinse thoroughly, and dry with a clean microfiber cloth to prevent scratches.

## Understanding Lexan and Its Cleaning Needs

Lexan is a thermoplastic polymer known for its exceptional durability. It’s significantly more impact-resistant than glass, making it ideal for applications like skylights, boat windows, and security glazing. However, unlike glass, Lexan is susceptible to scratching. This is why choosing the right cleaning method is crucial. Using abrasive cleaners or harsh scrubbing tools can quickly dull the surface, reducing clarity.  Understanding this sensitivity is the first step to keeping your Lexan windows sparkling.  Proper care will extend the life and beauty of your windows for years to come.

## Choosing the Right Cleaning Solution for Lexan

The key to cleaning Lexan is gentleness. Forget harsh chemicals and abrasive cleaners! These can cause irreversible damage. Instead, opt for a mild solution. A simple mixture of warm water and a few drops of dish soap is often the most effective and safest option. You can also find commercially available plastic cleaners specifically designed for polycarbonate.  Always test any cleaner in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t cause discoloration or damage.

## Essential Tools for Scratch-Free Lexan Cleaning

Using the right tools is just as important as the cleaning solution. Here’s what you’ll need:

*   **Soft Microfiber Cloths:** These are essential for both washing and drying. Avoid paper towels, as they can contain wood fibers that scratch the surface.
*   **Soft Sponge or Wash Mitt:** For applying the cleaning solution.
*   **Spray Bottle:** For easy application of the cleaning solution.
*   **Bucket:** To hold your cleaning solution.
*   **Distilled Water:** For rinsing, especially if your tap water is hard.

Avoid anything abrasive, like scouring pads, steel wool, or brushes with stiff bristles.  These will undoubtedly scratch your Lexan windows.  Investing in quality microfiber cloths is a small price to pay for protecting your investment.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Lexan Windows

Now that you have the right tools and solution, let's get cleaning!

1.  **Dust and Debris Removal:** Begin by removing loose dirt and debris with a soft brush or cloth. This prevents grinding particles into the surface during washing.
2.  **Prepare the Cleaning Solution:** Mix a few drops of mild dish soap with warm water in a bucket.
3.  **Apply the Solution:** Dip your soft sponge or wash mitt into the solution and gently wash the Lexan window. Use circular motions, applying light pressure.
4.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse the window thoroughly with clean, distilled water to remove all traces of soap.  Residual soap can attract dirt and leave streaks.
5.  **Dry with a Microfiber Cloth:** Immediately dry the window with a clean, dry microfiber cloth. This prevents water spots and streaks.

For stubborn grime, you can let the soapy water sit for a few minutes before rinsing, but avoid letting it dry completely.

## Dealing with Stubborn Stains and Scratches

Even with careful cleaning, you might encounter stubborn stains or minor scratches. Here’s how to address them:

*   **Water Spots:**  Vinegar diluted with water can help remove water spots. Apply, let sit for a few minutes, and rinse thoroughly.
*   **Bug Splatter:**  A plastic-safe bug remover can be used, but always test it in an inconspicuous area first.
*   **Minor Scratches:**  While deep scratches are difficult to remove, you can try a plastic polish specifically designed for polycarbonate. Follow the product instructions carefully.  However, be aware that polishing can sometimes distort the surface.
