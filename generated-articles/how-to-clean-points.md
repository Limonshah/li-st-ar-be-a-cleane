## How To Clean Distributor Points: A Step-by-Step Guide

Have you noticed your engine misfiring or running rough? The culprit could be dirty distributor points. Cleaning these small but vital components is a relatively simple task that can significantly improve your vehicle’s performance. This article will walk you through everything you need to know about how to clean points, ensuring a smoother ride and a more efficient engine. We’ll cover identifying dirty points, the tools you’ll need, the cleaning process, and preventative measures to keep them in top shape.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly inspect your distributor points for pitting and corrosion.
*   Use a dedicated points file or very fine sandpaper for cleaning.
*   Always disconnect the negative battery cable before working on the ignition system.
*   Properly adjust the points gap after cleaning for optimal performance.

**What are Distributor Points and Why Clean Them?**

Distributor points are a crucial part of older ignition systems. They act as a switch, opening and closing the circuit to the ignition coil, creating the spark that ignites the air-fuel mixture in your engine. Over time, these points accumulate carbon buildup and develop pitting due to the arcing electricity. This buildup interferes with their ability to make clean contact, leading to a weak spark, misfires, and reduced engine performance. Cleaning your points restores that clean contact, ensuring a strong spark and efficient combustion.

### Identifying Dirty Distributor Points

Before you start cleaning, you need to confirm that your points are indeed the problem. Several symptoms can indicate dirty or worn points. Look for a rough idling engine, difficulty starting, a loss of power, or noticeable misfires, especially under acceleration. Visually inspecting the points is also key. Remove the distributor cap and carefully examine the contact surfaces of the points. If you see black carbon buildup, pitting (small indentations), or corrosion, it’s time for a cleaning. You can also use a multimeter to check for continuity across the points when they are closed.

### Tools You’ll Need to Clean Points

Gathering the right tools before you begin will make the process much smoother. Here’s what you’ll need:

*   **Wrench:** To remove the distributor cap.
*   **Points File or Very Fine Sandpaper (400 grit or higher):** This is the primary tool for cleaning the contact surfaces.
*   **Distributor Point Gap Tool:** Essential for setting the correct gap after cleaning.
*   **Clean Rags:** For wiping away debris.
*   **Contact Cleaner (Electrical):** Helps remove stubborn residue.
*   **Screwdriver:** For adjusting the points gap.
*   **Gloves:** To protect your hands.
*   **Safety Glasses:** To protect your eyes.

### The Cleaning Process: Step-by-Step

Now, let's get to the cleaning process. Remember to disconnect the negative battery cable *before* starting any work on the ignition system to prevent accidental shocks.

1.  **Remove the Distributor Cap:** Carefully remove the distributor cap, noting its orientation for reinstallation.
2.  **Inspect the Points:** Visually inspect the points for carbon buildup, pitting, and corrosion.
3.  **Clean the Contact Surfaces:** Using a points file or very fine sandpaper, gently file the contact surfaces of both the stationary and moving points. Work in one direction only to avoid embedding debris. Don’t apply excessive pressure; the goal is to remove the buildup, not reshape the points.
4.  **Apply Contact Cleaner:** Spray a small amount of electrical contact cleaner onto a clean rag and wipe the points to remove any remaining residue.
5.  **Check and Adjust the Points Gap:** Use a distributor point gap tool to measure the gap between the points. Refer to your vehicle’s service manual for the correct gap specification. Adjust the gap using the adjustment screw on the distributor.
6.  **Reinstall the Distributor Cap:** Carefully reinstall the distributor cap, ensuring it’s oriented correctly.
7.  **Reconnect the Battery:** Reconnect the negative battery cable.
8.  **Test the Engine:** Start the engine and check for improved performance.

### Preventing Future Buildup and Corrosion

Cleaning your points is a temporary fix. To prolong their life and prevent frequent cleaning, consider these preventative measures. Regularly inspect your distributor cap for cracks or damage, as this can allow moisture and dirt to enter the system. Ensure the distributor is properly sealed. Consider using a high-quality fuel additive that helps keep the combustion chamber clean, reducing carbon buildup. If you don’t drive your vehicle frequently, consider using a fuel stabilizer to prevent fuel from degrading and leaving residue.

### Understanding Points Gap and Timing

The points gap is critical for proper ignition timing. A correctly set gap ensures that the points open and close at the precise moment, creating a strong spark. If the gap is too small, the points may stay closed for too long, causing the coil to overheat and potentially damaging the ignition system. If the gap is too large, the spark may be weak, leading to misfires. Proper timing is also essential for engine performance. After cleaning and adjusting the points, it’s a good idea to check and adjust the ignition timing using a timing light.

### When to Replace Points Instead of Cleaning

While cleaning can restore performance, points eventually wear down. If the points are severely pitted, burned, or worn thin, cleaning won’t be enough. In these cases, it’s best to replace the points with a new set. Replacing points is a relatively inexpensive and straightforward repair. Consider replacing the condenser at the same time, as a faulty condenser can also cause ignition problems. If you're unsure about replacing the points yourself, consult a qualified mechanic.

### FAQ

**Q: How often should I clean my distributor points?**

A: It depends on your driving conditions and the age of your vehicle. Generally, inspect them every 6,000-12,000 miles and clean them as needed. If you notice performance issues, check them sooner.

**Q: Can I use steel wool to clean distributor points?**

A: No, steel wool can leave behind tiny metal particles that can interfere with the ignition system. Use a points file or very fine sandpaper instead.

**Q: What does the condenser do in an ignition system?**

A: The condenser absorbs voltage spikes created when the points open, protecting the points from excessive wear and tear. A faulty condenser can cause points to burn out quickly.

**Q: What if I don’t know the correct points gap for my vehicle?**

A: Consult your vehicle’s service manual or a reliable online resource. Using the wrong gap can significantly affect engine performance.

**Q: Is cleaning points a permanent fix?**

A: No, cleaning is a temporary solution. Points will eventually wear out and need to be replaced.



## Conclusion

Cleaning your distributor points is a simple yet effective way to improve your vehicle’s performance, especially in older cars with traditional ignition systems. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can restore a strong spark, eliminate misfires, and enjoy a smoother ride. Remember to prioritize safety by disconnecting the battery and using the correct tools. Regular inspection and preventative maintenance will help prolong the life of your points and keep your engine running efficiently.
