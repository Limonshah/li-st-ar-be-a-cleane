## Daily Maintenance: Swabbing Your Wooden Recorder

Swabbing your recorder after *every* playing session is the most important thing you can do to keep it clean. This removes moisture, which is the biggest enemy of wood instruments.  Moisture buildup can lead to swelling, cracking, and mold growth.  A simple swab prevents these issues and keeps your recorder sounding its best.

Here’s how to swab your recorder effectively:

1.  **Detach the joints:** Carefully separate the head joint, middle joint, and foot joint.
2.  **Use a recorder swab:** A recorder swab is a piece of absorbent fabric attached to a cord.
3.  **Insert and pull through:** Attach the cord to the end of the swab and gently insert it into each joint. Slowly pull the swab through, ensuring it reaches all areas.
4.  **Repeat:** Repeat the process several times with a clean section of the swab each time.
5.  **Wipe the exterior:** Use a soft, dry cloth to wipe down the outside of the recorder.

## Deep Cleaning Your Wooden Recorder: A Step-by-Step Guide

While daily swabbing is crucial, a more thorough cleaning is needed periodically – typically once or twice a year. This deep cleaning removes accumulated grime and ensures all parts are functioning correctly.  It's a bit more involved, but well worth the effort.

1.  **Disassemble:** Carefully disassemble the recorder into its individual joints.
2.  **Warm Water Soak (Optional):**  Fill a bowl with lukewarm (not hot!) water.  Submerge the joints *briefly* – no more than 5-10 minutes. This loosens grime. *Never* soak the recorder for extended periods.
3.  **Gentle Cleaning Solution:** Add a drop or two of mild dish soap to lukewarm water. Avoid harsh detergents or abrasive cleaners.
4.  **Clean with a Swab:** Use a separate swab dampened with the soapy water to clean the inside of each joint.
5.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse each joint thoroughly with clean, lukewarm water to remove all traces of soap.
6.  **Dry Completely:** Allow all parts to air dry completely before reassembling.  This is *critical* to prevent mold growth. You can use a soft cloth to gently wipe away excess water.
7.  **Reassemble Carefully:** Once dry, carefully reassemble the recorder, ensuring all joints fit snugly.

## Protecting the Wood: Oiling Your Recorder

Wood needs oil to prevent it from drying out and cracking.  Think of it like moisturizing your skin!  Annual oiling keeps the wood supple and helps maintain its tone.  This is especially important for recorders that aren’t played frequently.

1.  **Recorder Oil:** Use a specifically formulated recorder oil, such as linseed oil or almond oil. *Do not* use mineral oil or other household oils.
2.  **Apply Sparingly:** Apply a very small amount of oil to a soft cloth.
3.  **Rub into the Wood:** Gently rub the oil into the exterior of the recorder, focusing on the bore (the inside of the instrument).
4.  **Wipe Off Excess:** After a few minutes, wipe off any excess oil with a clean, dry cloth.
5.  **Allow to Absorb:** Let the oil absorb into the wood for at least 24 hours before playing.

## Cleaning the Windway and Block

The windway and block are particularly sensitive areas that require careful cleaning. These parts directly affect the recorder’s tone and responsiveness.  A blocked windway can make the recorder difficult to play.

1.  **Remove the Block:** Carefully remove the block from the head joint.
2.  **Clean the Windway:** Use a pipe cleaner or a specialized windway cleaning tool to gently remove any debris from the windway. *Be extremely gentle* to avoid damaging the delicate windway.
3.  **Clean the Block:** Wipe the block with a soft, damp cloth.
4.  **Reassemble Carefully:** Reassemble the block and head joint, ensuring a secure fit.

## What *Not* To Do When Cleaning Your Wooden Recorder

Knowing what *not* to do is just as important as knowing what *to* do.  Using the wrong cleaning methods can cause irreversible damage.

*   **Avoid Hot Water:** Hot water can warp the wood.
*   **No Harsh Chemicals:**  Never use bleach, ammonia, or other harsh chemicals.
*   **Don't Use Abrasive Materials:** Avoid scouring pads or abrasive cleaners.
*   **Never Submerge for Long Periods:** Prolonged soaking can cause the wood to swell and crack.
*   **Avoid Excessive Force:** Be gentle when disassembling and cleaning the recorder.

Taking care of your recorder is similar to caring for other delicate wooden instruments. You might find information on maintaining other instruments helpful, such as our guide on [how to clean a baritone](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-baritone).
