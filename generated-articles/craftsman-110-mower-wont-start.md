## Craftsman 110 Mower Won't Start: A Troubleshooting Guide

Is your weekend mowing plan stalled because your Craftsman 110 mower won’t start? It’s a common frustration, but often a solvable one. This article will walk you through the most likely causes and provide step-by-step instructions to get your mower running again. We’ll cover everything from simple fixes like checking the gas to more involved troubleshooting like inspecting the spark plug. Let's get your yard looking great again!

**Takeaway:**

*   Check the fuel system for old gas or clogs.
*   Inspect the spark plug for fouling or damage.
*   Ensure the safety features are functioning correctly.
*   Consider a carburetor cleaning if other solutions fail.

**Quick Answer:** A Craftsman 110 mower that won’t start usually stems from fuel issues, a faulty spark plug, or a safety switch problem. Checking these three areas first will often resolve the issue and get you mowing.

## 1. Fuel System Issues: The Most Common Culprit

Often, a Craftsman 110 mower won’t start because of problems with the fuel system. Old or stale gasoline is a frequent offender, especially if the mower sat unused over the winter. Gasoline degrades over time, losing its volatility and making it difficult for the engine to ignite.  First, drain the old fuel from the tank. Then, add fresh gasoline, ideally with a fuel stabilizer to prevent future degradation. 

Another potential issue is a clogged fuel filter or carburetor. A clogged fuel filter restricts fuel flow, while a dirty carburetor prevents proper fuel-air mixture. You can try using a fuel system cleaner additive, but if that doesn’t work, you may need to clean or replace the fuel filter and potentially rebuild the carburetor.

## 2. Spark Plug Problems: No Spark, No Start

If the fuel system seems fine, the next step is to check the spark plug. The spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture, and without a good spark, the engine won’t start. Remove the spark plug and visually inspect it for fouling (carbon buildup), cracks, or damage. A fouled spark plug can be cleaned with a wire brush, but if it’s cracked or severely damaged, it needs to be replaced. 

To test if the spark plug is producing a spark, reconnect it to the spark plug wire, ground the metal body of the plug against the engine block, and pull the starter cord. You should see a bright blue spark. If there’s no spark, or the spark is weak and orange, replace the spark plug.

## 3. Safety Switch Malfunctions: Preventing Accidental Starts

Craftsman 110 mowers are equipped with several safety switches designed to prevent accidental starts. These include the operator presence switch (OPS) on the handle and the blade engagement switch. If either of these switches is faulty, the mower won’t start, even if everything else is working correctly. 

Check that the operator presence switch is fully engaged when you’re trying to start the mower. Also, ensure the blade engagement lever is in the disengaged position. If the mower still won’t start, you may need to test the switches with a multimeter to see if they’re functioning properly.  Sometimes, a simple cleaning of the switch contacts can resolve the issue.

## 4. Checking the Battery and Starter (Electric Start Models)

If your Craftsman 110 has an electric start, a weak or dead battery is a common reason it won’t start. Test the battery voltage with a multimeter; it should read at least 12.6 volts when fully charged. If the voltage is low, charge the battery using a battery charger. If the battery won’t hold a charge, it needs to be replaced.

Even with a fully charged battery, a faulty starter motor or solenoid can prevent the engine from cranking. Listen for a clicking sound when you turn the key; if you hear a click but the engine doesn’t crank, the solenoid may be the problem. If you don’t hear any sound, the starter motor itself may be faulty.

## 5. Air Filter Inspection: Ensuring Proper Airflow

A dirty or clogged air filter restricts airflow to the engine, which can cause starting problems. Remove the air filter and inspect it for dirt and debris. If it’s dirty, clean it by tapping it gently to remove loose particles, or replace it with a new one. A clean air filter ensures the engine receives the proper amount of air for combustion. 

Regularly cleaning or replacing the air filter is a simple maintenance task that can significantly improve your mower’s performance and longevity.

## 6. Carburetor Cleaning: A More Involved Solution

If you’ve checked the fuel system, spark plug, and safety switches, and your Craftsman 110 still won’t start, a more thorough carburetor cleaning may be necessary. Over time, the carburetor can become clogged with varnish and deposits, restricting fuel flow and disrupting the fuel-air mixture. 

Cleaning the carburetor involves disassembling it, soaking the parts in carburetor cleaner, and then reassembling it. This is a more complex task, and if you’re not comfortable doing it yourself, it’s best to take the mower to a qualified repair technician.

## 7. Addressing Issues After Winter Storage

If your Craftsman 110 mower hasn’t been used for several months, especially over the winter, it’s common for it to be difficult to start.  Old fuel is a major culprit, as mentioned earlier.  However, moisture can also accumulate in the fuel tank and carburetor, causing corrosion and blockages. 

Before attempting to start the mower after winter storage, drain the old fuel, add fresh fuel with stabilizer, and consider using a fuel system cleaner.  You might also want to check the spark plug and air filter, as these can also be affected by prolonged storage.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Why won’t my Craftsman 110 start even after checking the gas?**
A: Even with gas, a clogged carburetor, a faulty spark plug, or a malfunctioning safety switch can prevent starting. Thoroughly inspect these components.

**Q: How often should I replace the spark plug on my Craftsman 110?**
A: Typically, you should replace the spark plug every 100 hours of use or annually, whichever comes first.

**Q: What does it mean if my mower cranks but won’t start?**
A: This usually indicates a fuel delivery problem, such as a clogged carburetor or fuel filter, or a lack of spark.

**Q: Can I use gasoline that’s a few months old?**
A: While it *might* work, gasoline degrades over time. Using fresh gasoline is always recommended for optimal performance.

**Q: Is it safe to use starter fluid?**
A: Starter fluid can help temporarily, but it’s not a long-term solution. It masks the underlying problem and can be harmful to the engine if used excessively.



## Conclusion

Getting your Craftsman 110 mower started again doesn’t have to be a daunting task. By systematically checking the fuel system, spark plug, safety switches, and air filter, you can often diagnose and fix the problem yourself. Remember, a little preventative maintenance can go a long way in keeping your mower running smoothly for years to come. Don’t let a stubborn mower ruin your weekend – take the time to troubleshoot and get back to enjoying your yard!
