## Keeping Your Sanctuary Fresh: How To Clean An Infrared Sauna

Do you love the relaxing benefits of your infrared sauna? Regular cleaning is essential to maintain a hygienic and enjoyable experience. An infrared sauna, like any space dedicated to wellness, can accumulate sweat, oils, and dust. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about how to clean an infrared sauna, ensuring it remains a safe and rejuvenating space for years to come. We’ll cover everything from daily wipe-downs to deep cleaning schedules, and the best products to use.

**Takeaway:**

*   Wipe down surfaces after each use.
*   Deep clean monthly with mild soap and water.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals that can damage the sauna.
*   Proper ventilation is key to preventing mold and mildew.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean an infrared sauna, wipe down all surfaces after each use with a soft cloth. Monthly, use a mild soap and water solution to deep clean, avoiding harsh chemicals. Ensure the sauna is completely dry before use, and prioritize good ventilation to prevent mold growth.

## Why Regular Infrared Sauna Cleaning Matters

Cleaning your infrared sauna isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about health and longevity. Sweat contains salts and oils that can build up over time, creating a breeding ground for bacteria. This can lead to unpleasant odors and potentially compromise your health. Regular cleaning prevents this buildup, ensuring a sanitary environment for each session. Furthermore, proper maintenance extends the life of your sauna, protecting your investment.

## Daily Maintenance: A Quick Wipe-Down Routine

The easiest way to keep your infrared sauna clean is to incorporate a quick wipe-down into your post-sauna routine. After each use, use a soft cloth or paper towel to wipe down the benches, walls, and floor. This removes fresh sweat and oils before they can become difficult to remove. You can lightly dampen the cloth with water if needed, but avoid soaking the wood. [Learn more about maintaining a clean sauna](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-sauna) for additional tips.

## Monthly Deep Cleaning: A Step-by-Step Guide

While daily wipe-downs are crucial, a monthly deep clean is necessary for thorough sanitation. Here’s how to do it:

1.  **Power Down & Cool:** Turn off and unplug your sauna. Allow it to cool completely before starting.
2.  **Prepare Your Solution:** Mix a small amount of mild soap (like dish soap) with warm water. Avoid harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, or bleach, as these can damage the wood and heaters.
3.  **Wipe Down Surfaces:** Dip a soft cloth into the soapy water and wring it out well. Gently wipe down all interior surfaces, including the benches, walls, and floor.
4.  **Rinse:** Use a clean, damp cloth to rinse away any soap residue.
5.  **Dry Thoroughly:** This is the most important step! Use a dry cloth to thoroughly dry all surfaces. Moisture can lead to mold and mildew growth.
6.  **Ventilate:** Leave the sauna door open for several hours to allow for complete air circulation.

## Cleaning Different Sauna Materials

Infrared saunas are often constructed from different materials, each requiring slightly different care.

### Wood Surfaces

Most infrared saunas feature wood interiors, typically cedar or hemlock. These woods are naturally resistant to moisture, but still require regular cleaning. Avoid excessive water and always dry surfaces thoroughly. You can occasionally apply a wood conditioner specifically designed for saunas to help maintain the wood’s health and appearance.

### Heaters

The heaters are a critical component of your infrared sauna and require gentle cleaning. Never spray cleaning solutions directly onto the heaters. Instead, lightly dampen a cloth with your mild soap solution and carefully wipe around the heaters, avoiding direct contact with the heating elements.

### Glass Panels

If your sauna has glass panels, clean them with a glass cleaner specifically designed for home use. Avoid abrasive cleaners that can scratch the glass. You can also use a vinegar and water solution for a natural cleaning option. [How often to clean windows](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-often-to-clean-windows) can be a good guide for frequency.

## Preventing Mold and Mildew Growth

Mold and mildew thrive in warm, damp environments, making infrared saunas potentially susceptible. Here’s how to prevent growth:

*   **Ventilation:** Always ensure adequate ventilation after each use and during deep cleaning.
*   **Thorough Drying:** As mentioned before, drying all surfaces completely is crucial.
*   **Monitor Humidity:** If you live in a humid climate, consider using a dehumidifier near the sauna to reduce moisture levels.
*   **Regular Inspection:** Periodically inspect the sauna for any signs of mold or mildew. If you find any, address it immediately with a mold-killing cleaner specifically designed for wood.

## Dealing with Stubborn Stains and Odors

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, stains or odors may linger. Here are a few solutions:

*   **Sweat Stains:** For stubborn sweat stains on wood, try making a paste of baking soda and water. Apply the paste to the stain, let it sit for a few minutes, and then gently scrub with a soft cloth.
*   **Odor Removal:** To neutralize odors, place a small bowl of baking soda inside the sauna between uses. You can also use a few drops of essential oil (like eucalyptus or tea tree oil) on a cloth to freshen the air.
*   **Deep Odor Removal:** If odors persist, consider a specialized sauna cleaner designed to eliminate odors without damaging the materials.

## FAQ: Your Infrared Sauna Cleaning Questions Answered

**Q: Can I use bleach to clean my infrared sauna?**

A: No, absolutely not. Bleach is a harsh chemical that can damage the wood, heaters, and other components of your sauna. It can also release harmful fumes. Always opt for mild soap and water.

**Q: How often should I replace the wood on my sauna benches?**

A: The lifespan of your sauna benches depends on usage and maintenance. With proper care, they can last for many years. However, if the wood becomes significantly cracked, warped, or damaged, it’s time to replace it.

**Q: What’s the best way to clean the floor of my infrared sauna?**

A: Sweep or vacuum the floor regularly to remove dust and debris. For deep cleaning, use a mild soap and water solution, ensuring you don’t saturate the wood. Dry thoroughly afterward.

**Q: Can I use a steam cleaner in my infrared sauna?**

A: It’s generally not recommended to use a steam cleaner in an infrared sauna. The excessive moisture can damage the wood and heaters. Stick to manual cleaning with a damp cloth.
