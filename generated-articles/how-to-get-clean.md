## How To Get Clean: A Complete Guide

Feeling clean isn’t just about appearances; it’s vital for your health and well-being.  This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about how to get clean, covering both personal hygiene and keeping your living space spotless. We’ll break down the process into manageable steps, offering practical advice for a consistently clean life. Let's dive in and discover how to achieve a truly clean slate!

**Takeaway:**

*   Prioritize daily showering/bathing and handwashing.
*   Establish a regular cleaning schedule for your home.
*   Focus on disinfecting high-touch surfaces.
*   Declutter regularly to simplify cleaning.

**What does it mean to "get clean?"**

Getting clean involves maintaining both personal and environmental hygiene. This means regularly washing your body, clothes, and living space to remove dirt, germs, and pollutants. It’s a proactive approach to health and well-being, contributing to a more comfortable and sanitary lifestyle.

## The Importance of Personal Hygiene

Personal hygiene is the foundation of getting clean. It’s not just about smelling good; it’s about preventing the spread of illness and maintaining your overall health.  Consistent personal hygiene habits protect you and those around you from harmful bacteria and viruses. Let’s explore some key areas.

### Daily Showering or Bathing

A daily shower or bath is crucial for removing dirt, sweat, and bacteria from your skin.  Use warm water and a mild soap, focusing on areas prone to sweat, like your underarms and feet.  Don't forget to thoroughly dry yourself afterward to prevent fungal growth.  If you have sensitive skin, consider using fragrance-free products.

### Handwashing: Your First Line of Defense

Washing your hands frequently is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of germs.  Wash with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the restroom, before eating, and after being in public places.  If soap and water aren’t available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.  Keeping your hands clean is a simple yet powerful habit.

### Oral Hygiene: Beyond a Bright Smile

Good oral hygiene is essential for preventing cavities, gum disease, and bad breath. Brush your teeth at least twice a day with fluoride toothpaste, and floss daily to remove plaque and food particles from between your teeth.  Regular dental checkups are also important for maintaining optimal oral health.

## Creating a Home Cleaning Schedule

A clean home contributes significantly to your overall well-being.  However, the thought of cleaning an entire house can be overwhelming.  Breaking it down into a manageable schedule makes the task much less daunting.  Here’s how to create a cleaning routine that works for you.

### Daily Tasks: Small Efforts, Big Impact

Incorporate these quick tasks into your daily routine: making your bed, wiping down kitchen counters, sweeping or vacuuming high-traffic areas, and doing a load of laundry. These small efforts prevent dirt and clutter from accumulating, making deeper cleaning easier.  A little bit each day goes a long way.

### Weekly Tasks: A More Thorough Clean

Dedicate a few hours each week to more thorough cleaning tasks. This includes cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming or mopping floors, dusting surfaces, and emptying all trash cans.  Consider creating a checklist to ensure you don’t miss anything.  You might also want to check [how-to-clean-bathroom](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bathroom) for detailed instructions.

### Monthly & Seasonal Tasks: Deep Cleaning & Maintenance

Monthly tasks include cleaning appliances (like your oven – see [how-to-clean-oven-after-self-clean](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-oven-after-self-clean)), washing curtains, and cleaning light fixtures. Seasonal tasks, done a few times a year, involve deep cleaning carpets, washing windows ([how-to-clean-window](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-window)), and decluttering closets.

## Disinfecting High-Touch Surfaces

Disinfecting high-touch surfaces is crucial for eliminating germs and preventing the spread of illness. These surfaces include doorknobs, light switches, countertops, faucets, and remote controls.  Use a disinfectant cleaner that is effective against bacteria and viruses.  Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for proper use.

### Choosing the Right Disinfectant

There are many disinfectant cleaners available, so choose one that is appropriate for the surface you are cleaning.  Some disinfectants are designed for specific surfaces, such as stainless steel or granite.  Consider using eco-friendly disinfectants to minimize your environmental impact.

### Proper Disinfecting Technique

To properly disinfect a surface, first clean it with soap and water to remove dirt and grime. Then, apply the disinfectant cleaner and allow it to sit for the recommended amount of time (usually several minutes). Finally, wipe the surface clean with a clean cloth.  Don't forget to wear gloves and eye protection when using disinfectants.

## The Power of Decluttering

Decluttering is an essential part of getting clean.  A cluttered space is harder to clean and can contribute to stress and anxiety.  Regularly decluttering your home simplifies cleaning and creates a more peaceful living environment.

### The KonMari Method

The KonMari method, popularized by Marie Kondo, encourages you to declutter by asking yourself if each item “sparks joy.” If it doesn’t, thank it for its service and let it go. This method can be surprisingly effective in helping you identify items you no longer need.

### One-In, One-Out Rule

To prevent clutter from accumulating, adopt the “one-in, one-out” rule.  Whenever you bring a new item into your home, get rid of a similar item. This helps maintain a balance and prevents your belongings from taking over your space.

## Cleaning Products: Natural vs. Commercial

Choosing the right cleaning products is important for both your health and the environment.  You can choose between natural cleaning products and commercial cleaners.  Each option has its pros and cons.

### Natural Cleaning Solutions

Natural cleaning solutions, such as vinegar, baking soda, and lemon juice, are effective and environmentally friendly. They are also less likely to cause allergic reactions or respiratory problems. However, they may require more effort to use and may not be as effective against certain types of dirt and grime.

### Commercial Cleaning Products

Commercial cleaning products are often more powerful and convenient to use. However, they can contain harsh chemicals that are harmful to your health and the environment.  If you choose to use commercial cleaners, be sure to read the label carefully and follow the manufacturer’s instructions.
