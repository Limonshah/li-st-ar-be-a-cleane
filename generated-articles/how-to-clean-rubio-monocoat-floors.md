## Keeping Your Floors Beautiful: How To Clean Rubio Monocoat Floors

Have you invested in the stunning, natural beauty of Rubio Monocoat floors? These floors are prized for their durability and unique finish, but maintaining that beauty requires a specific cleaning approach.  Unlike traditional polyurethane finishes, Rubio Monocoat is an oil-based finish, meaning standard cleaning methods can actually damage it. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about how to clean Rubio Monocoat floors, from daily maintenance to tackling stubborn stains, ensuring your investment lasts for years to come. We’ll cover the right products, techniques, and preventative measures to keep your floors looking their best.

**Takeaway:**

*   Use a dry method for daily cleaning – vacuuming or dust mopping.
*   For deeper cleaning, use Rubio Monocoat Soap.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals, vinegar, and excessive water.
*   Regular maintenance prevents buildup and keeps your floors looking beautiful.

**What is the best way to clean Rubio Monocoat floors?**

Rubio Monocoat floors are best cleaned with regular dry cleaning and occasional use of Rubio Monocoat Soap diluted in water. Avoid harsh chemicals and excessive water, as these can damage the oil finish. Consistent, gentle cleaning will preserve the floor’s natural beauty and longevity.



## Understanding the Rubio Monocoat Finish

Rubio Monocoat isn’t like your typical floor finish. It’s a plant-based oil finish that penetrates the wood, rather than sitting on top of it. This creates a durable, breathable finish that highlights the natural wood grain. Because it’s an oil finish, it reacts differently to cleaning products than polyurethane or varnish.  Traditional wood floor cleaners often contain harsh chemicals that can strip the oil, leaving your floors dull and unprotected. Understanding this fundamental difference is key to proper cleaning. 

## Daily Maintenance: Dust and Debris Removal

The easiest way to keep your Rubio Monocoat floors looking great is consistent daily maintenance. This primarily involves removing dust, dirt, and debris before they can scratch or dull the finish.  Regularly sweeping or vacuuming is crucial. Use a vacuum with a soft brush attachment to avoid scratching the wood.  Alternatively, a microfiber dust mop is an excellent choice, as it effectively traps dust and dirt without leaving residue.  This simple step significantly reduces the need for more intensive cleaning.

## Deep Cleaning with Rubio Monocoat Soap

While daily dry cleaning is essential, periodic deep cleaning is also necessary.  For this, you’ll need Rubio Monocoat Soap, specifically formulated for this type of finish.  This soap is pH-neutral and won’t damage the oil.  To use it, dilute one capful of soap into a bucket of lukewarm water.  Then, use a well-wrung-out mop (microfiber is best) to gently clean the floor.  Avoid letting water pool on the surface.

## Tackling Spills and Stains Immediately

Accidents happen, and spills are inevitable. The key with Rubio Monocoat floors is to address spills *immediately*.  Blot up liquids with a clean, absorbent cloth.  Avoid rubbing, as this can spread the stain. For sticky spills like juice or syrup, gently scrape away any excess with a plastic scraper before blotting.  For more stubborn stains, Rubio Monocoat offers specific stain removers designed to address different types of blemishes.  Don't hesitate to consult their website for guidance.

### Common Stain Solutions

*   **Water Spots:** Usually, these will disappear on their own. If not, lightly dampen a cloth with water and gently wipe the area.
*   **Oil-Based Stains (Grease, Oil):**  Apply a paste of baking soda and water, let it sit for a few hours, then wipe clean.
*   **Pet Accidents:** Clean up immediately and use a pet-specific enzymatic cleaner designed for wood floors.  You can find more information on cleaning up after pets on [how to keep hardwood floors clean of dog hair](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-keep-hardwood-floors-clean-of-dog-hair).



## What to Avoid When Cleaning Rubio Monocoat Floors

Knowing what *not* to do is just as important as knowing what to do.  Several common cleaning agents can damage your Rubio Monocoat finish.  Avoid using vinegar, ammonia, bleach, abrasive cleaners, and steam mops.  These products can strip the oil, leaving your floors vulnerable to water damage and discoloration.  Also, avoid excessive water.  Rubio Monocoat floors are durable, but they aren’t waterproof.  Always use a well-wrung-out mop and dry the floor thoroughly after cleaning.  If you've dealt with greasy messes before, you might be tempted to use strong chemicals, but avoid that and instead read this article on [how to clean greasy hardwood floors](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-greasy-hardwood-floors).

## Restoring and Maintaining the Finish

Over time, even with diligent cleaning, your Rubio Monocoat floors may show signs of wear.  Fortunately, restoring the finish is relatively easy.  Rubio Monocoat offers a Refresh Soap, designed to revitalize the oil finish and restore its original luster.  Apply it according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  For more significant damage, you may need to apply a new coat of Rubio Monocoat oil.  This is a DIY-friendly project, but it’s important to follow the instructions carefully.



## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can I use a Swiffer WetJet on Rubio Monocoat floors?**

A: No, Swiffer WetJets and similar spray mops often use cleaning solutions that are too harsh for Rubio Monocoat. They also tend to leave too much moisture on the floor, which can damage the finish.

**Q: How often should I deep clean my Rubio Monocoat floors?**

A:  Deep cleaning with Rubio Monocoat Soap should be done every 1-3 months, depending on foot traffic and usage.

**Q:  What’s the best way to prevent scratches on my Rubio Monocoat floors?**

A: Use area rugs in high-traffic areas, place felt pads under furniture legs, and avoid wearing shoes with heels or abrasive soles indoors.

**Q: Can I use essential oils to clean my Rubio Monocoat floors?**

A: While some essential oils have cleaning properties, they can potentially react with the oil finish. It’s best to stick to Rubio Monocoat Soap for cleaning.

**Q: My floors look dull. Can I revive them?**

A: Yes! Using Rubio Monocoat Refresh Soap can often restore the luster. If that doesn’t work, a new coat of Rubio Monocoat oil may be necessary.
