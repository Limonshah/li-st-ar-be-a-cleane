## Keeping Your Laundry Fresh: How to Clean a Speed Queen Washer

Is your laundry not smelling as fresh as it should? A dirty washing machine could be the culprit! Many people focus on detergent and fabric softener, but forget about cleaning the machine itself. This article will guide you through how to clean a Speed Queen washer, ensuring optimal performance and fresh, clean clothes every time. We’ll cover everything from routine cleaning to tackling tougher issues, keeping your Speed Queen running smoothly for years to come.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning prevents buildup and odors.
*   Use the washer clean cycle (if equipped) with a washer cleaner.
*   Clean the dispenser drawers and door gasket frequently.
*   Inspect and clean the drain pump filter periodically.

A clean washing machine is essential for truly clean clothes. Speed Queen washers are known for their durability and efficiency, but even these robust machines need regular maintenance. Let's dive into the best ways to keep yours in top condition.

### Why Cleaning Your Speed Queen Washer Matters

You might be surprised to learn that your washing machine can get dirty! Over time, detergent residue, fabric softener, minerals from hard water, and even mold and mildew can accumulate inside. This buildup can lead to unpleasant odors, reduced washing performance, and even damage to your machine. Cleaning your Speed Queen washer regularly prevents these issues, extending its lifespan and ensuring your clothes come out fresh and clean. It’s a simple task that makes a big difference.

### Routine Cleaning: The Washer Clean Cycle

Many Speed Queen washers come equipped with a dedicated washer clean cycle. This is the easiest way to maintain a clean machine. If your model has this feature, use it monthly. Add a washing machine cleaner specifically designed for HE (High Efficiency) washers – about 2-4 tablespoons is usually sufficient. Run the cycle with hot water, and let the machine do the work! This cycle typically uses a higher water level and extended wash time to thoroughly clean the drum and internal components.

### Cleaning the Dispenser Drawers

The dispenser drawers for detergent, bleach, and fabric softener are prime locations for buildup. Residue can harden and clog the dispensers, affecting their performance. To clean them, remove the drawers from the washer (consult your owner’s manual for specific instructions). Wash the drawers with warm, soapy water, using a brush to scrub away any hardened residue. Rinse thoroughly and allow them to dry completely before reinserting them into the washer. Regularly cleaning these drawers ensures proper dispensing and prevents clogs.

### Addressing the Door Gasket (Front Load Washers)

If you have a front-load Speed Queen washer, the door gasket requires special attention. This rubber seal around the door can trap moisture, lint, and mildew. After each wash, wipe down the gasket with a clean, dry cloth. Periodically, lift the gasket to check for hidden debris and mold. To disinfect, mix a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar and spray it onto the gasket. Let it sit for a few minutes, then wipe clean. A clean gasket prevents leaks and keeps odors at bay.

### Cleaning the Drain Pump Filter

The drain pump filter catches lint, hair, and small objects to prevent them from clogging the drain pump. It’s important to clean this filter regularly – typically every 3-6 months, or more often if you wash a lot of pet bedding or heavily soiled items. Locate the filter access panel (refer to your owner’s manual). Place a shallow pan or towel underneath to catch any water that may spill out. Carefully remove the filter and clean it thoroughly, removing any debris. Rinse the filter and reinsert it securely. A clean drain pump filter ensures proper drainage and prevents potential damage to your washer.

### Dealing with Stubborn Odors

Even with regular cleaning, some Speed Queen washers may develop stubborn odors. If this happens, try running a wash cycle with hot water and 1 cup of white vinegar. Vinegar is a natural deodorizer and disinfectant. Alternatively, you can use a commercial washing machine cleaner specifically designed to eliminate odors. Ensure the washer is completely empty during this cycle. If odors persist, consider repeating the process or contacting a qualified appliance repair technician.

### Hard Water Considerations

If you have hard water, mineral buildup can be a significant problem. Minerals can accumulate inside the washer, reducing its efficiency and potentially causing damage. Consider using a water softener or a washing machine cleaner specifically formulated to remove mineral deposits. You can also add a cup of white vinegar to the rinse cycle to help prevent buildup. Regularly cleaning your Speed Queen washer is even more crucial if you have hard water.
