## How To Clean Your Jordan 12s: A Step-by-Step Guide

Do your Jordan 12s need a refresh? These iconic sneakers are a statement piece, but they require proper care to maintain their appearance. Cleaning your Jordan 12s doesn’t have to be daunting. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to safely and effectively clean your shoes, keeping them looking their best for years to come. We’ll cover everything from gathering supplies to tackling tough stains.

**Takeaway:**

*   Gather your cleaning supplies: soft brush, mild soap, microfiber cloths, and water.
*   Remove loose dirt and debris before deep cleaning.
*   Clean the leather upper gently with a soapy solution.
*   Pay attention to the midsole and outsole, using a slightly stiffer brush.
*   Allow your Jordan 12s to air dry completely.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean Jordan 12s, gently brush off loose dirt, mix mild soap with water, and use a soft brush to clean the leather upper. Rinse with a damp cloth and air dry, avoiding direct heat.

## 1. Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies for Jordan 12s

Before you start, having the right tools is crucial for a successful clean. You don’t want to damage the leather or other materials. Here’s what you’ll need to effectively clean your Jordan 12s: a soft-bristled brush (an old toothbrush works well!), mild liquid soap (dish soap or sneaker cleaner), microfiber cloths, and lukewarm water.  Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can discolor or damage the leather.  Having these items ready will make the cleaning process much smoother.

You might also consider a sneaker cleaning kit, which often includes specialized brushes and solutions. If you're looking for a deeper clean for other areas of your home, you might find resources on [how to clean home](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-home) helpful.

## 2. Preparing Your Jordan 12s for Cleaning

The first step in cleaning your Jordan 12s is to remove any loose dirt or debris. Use the soft-bristled brush to gently brush away any dust, mud, or grime from the entire shoe. Pay close attention to the grooves in the outsole and around the seams. Removing this loose debris prevents it from turning into a stubborn stain during the cleaning process.  This step is often overlooked, but it makes a significant difference in the final result.

After brushing, remove the laces. You can wash these separately with soap and water, or even replace them if they’re heavily soiled.  Consider cleaning your laces while you're cleaning the shoes to save time.

## 3. Cleaning the Leather Upper of Your Jordan 12s

The leather upper is the most prominent part of the Jordan 12, and requires gentle care. Mix a small amount of mild liquid soap with lukewarm water to create a soapy solution. Dip a clean microfiber cloth into the solution, wring it out well, and gently wipe down the leather upper. Avoid saturating the leather with water. Work in small sections, using circular motions to lift dirt and grime. 

For tougher stains, you can apply a small amount of the soapy solution directly to the stain and gently scrub with the soft-bristled brush. Remember to test any cleaning solution in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t cause discoloration.

## 4. Cleaning the Midsole and Outsole

The midsole and outsole of your Jordan 12s are often the dirtiest parts. Use a slightly stiffer brush (but still avoid anything abrasive) and the same soapy solution to scrub these areas. Pay attention to the grooves in the outsole, where dirt and debris can accumulate.  You may need to apply a little more pressure to remove stubborn dirt, but be careful not to damage the rubber.

Rinse the brush frequently with clean water to avoid spreading dirt around.  For particularly stubborn marks on the outsole, you can use a magic eraser, but test it in a small area first.  Keeping these areas clean will significantly improve the overall appearance of your shoes.

## 5. Dealing with Specific Stains on Jordan 12s

Different stains require different approaches. Here’s how to tackle some common issues:

*   **Mud:** Let the mud dry completely, then brush it off gently. If a stain remains, use the soapy solution described above.
*   **Scuff Marks:** A clean, damp microfiber cloth can often remove light scuff marks. For more stubborn scuffs, consider a specialized scuff remover.
*   **Oil Stains:** Sprinkle baking soda on the stain and let it sit for several hours to absorb the oil. Then, brush it off and clean the area with the soapy solution.
*   **Water Stains:** Gently wipe the entire shoe with a damp cloth to create a uniform appearance.

Remember to always test any cleaning solution in an inconspicuous area before applying it to the entire shoe.  If you're looking for ways to maintain other items, you might find information on [how to clean a backpack](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-backpack) useful.

## 6. Drying Your Jordan 12s Properly

After cleaning, it’s crucial to dry your Jordan 12s properly. Never put them in the dryer or expose them to direct heat, as this can damage the leather and cause them to shrink or warp. Instead, stuff the shoes with clean paper towels or shoe trees to help them maintain their shape and absorb excess moisture. 

Allow the shoes to air dry in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight. This process can take several hours, or even overnight. Once the shoes are completely dry, you can re-lace them and enjoy your freshly cleaned Jordan 12s.  Proper drying is just as important as the cleaning itself.

## 7. Protecting Your Clean Jordan 12s

Once your Jordan 12s are clean, you’ll want to protect them from future dirt and stains. Consider applying a leather protector spray to help repel water and stains. This will make future cleaning much easier.  Also, store your shoes in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.  

Regular cleaning and protection will help keep your Jordan 12s looking their best for years to come.  If you're looking for ways to protect other items, you might find information on [how to clean fiberglass](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-fiberglass) helpful.
