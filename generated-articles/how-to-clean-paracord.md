## Keeping Your Lifeline Fresh: How To Clean Paracord

Ever wonder how to keep your trusty paracord in top condition? Paracord is incredibly versatile, used for everything from survival bracelets to securing gear. But with all that use, it inevitably gets dirty. This article will show you exactly how to clean paracord, ensuring its longevity and reliability. We’ll cover everything from simple spot cleaning to more thorough washing methods, so your paracord is always ready for action. Let's dive in and learn how to maintain this essential material!

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning prevents dirt buildup and maintains paracord strength.
*   Mild soap and cool water are best for most cleaning situations.
*   Air drying is crucial to avoid damage and shrinkage.
*   Proper storage extends the life of your paracord.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean paracord, hand wash it with mild soap and cool water. Gently scrub away dirt, rinse thoroughly, and air dry completely, avoiding direct sunlight or heat. This simple process keeps your paracord strong and ready for use.

## Why Cleaning Your Paracord Matters

Paracord, despite its durability, isn’t invincible. Dirt, grime, and even exposure to the elements can weaken the inner strands over time. Regularly cleaning your paracord isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about maintaining its structural integrity. Think of it like this: a clean cord is a strong cord. Removing debris prevents abrasion and ensures the individual strands within the sheath remain intact. 

Furthermore, certain environments can introduce contaminants that degrade the nylon material. Saltwater, for example, can cause corrosion, while prolonged exposure to UV rays can lead to fading and brittleness. Keeping your paracord clean helps mitigate these effects, extending its lifespan and ensuring it performs when you need it most.

## Simple Spot Cleaning for Quick Maintenance

Sometimes, a full wash isn’t necessary. For minor dirt or grime, spot cleaning is a quick and effective solution. This is ideal for removing small stains or dust accumulated during light use. Simply mix a small amount of mild soap with cool water. 

Dip a clean cloth into the soapy water and gently wipe the affected area of the paracord. Avoid harsh scrubbing, as this can damage the outer sheath. Rinse the area with clean water and allow it to air dry. This method is perfect for maintaining your paracord between more thorough cleanings.

## Deep Cleaning Paracord: A Step-by-Step Guide

When your paracord is truly dirty, a more comprehensive cleaning is required. This involves a gentle hand wash to remove embedded grime. Start by filling a basin or sink with cool water and a small amount of mild detergent – dish soap works well. Avoid using harsh chemicals or bleach, as these can damage the nylon fibers.

Submerge the paracord in the soapy water and gently agitate it to loosen dirt. You can use your hands or a soft brush to scrub away stubborn stains. Rinse the paracord thoroughly under clean, running water until all traces of soap are gone. Finally, gently squeeze out excess water (do *not* wring) and proceed to the drying stage.

## The Importance of Proper Drying

Drying is arguably the most crucial step in cleaning paracord. Improper drying can lead to shrinkage, deformation, or even damage to the inner strands. *Never* put paracord in a dryer. The heat will melt and weaken the nylon.

Instead, lay the paracord flat on a clean, dry surface or hang it to air dry in a shaded area. Avoid direct sunlight, as UV rays can degrade the material. Ensure the paracord is completely dry before storing it. This may take several hours, depending on the length and thickness of the cord.

## Dealing with Stubborn Stains and Odors

Sometimes, paracord encounters particularly challenging stains or develops unpleasant odors. For oil-based stains, a degreasing agent may be necessary. Apply a small amount of the degreaser to the stain, let it sit for a few minutes, and then gently scrub with a soft brush. Rinse thoroughly with water.

For odors, soaking the paracord in a solution of water and baking soda can help neutralize them. Use about one tablespoon of baking soda per gallon of water. Let the paracord soak for several hours, then rinse thoroughly and air dry.

## Storing Your Clean Paracord for Longevity

Proper storage is essential for maintaining the condition of your clean paracord. Avoid storing it in direct sunlight or in areas with high humidity. These conditions can accelerate degradation. 

Coil the paracord loosely and store it in a dry, well-ventilated area. A mesh bag or a dedicated storage container is ideal. Avoid tightly winding the paracord, as this can create stress points and potentially weaken the inner strands. Taking these simple steps will ensure your paracord remains in excellent condition for years to come.



## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can I use bleach to clean paracord?**
A: No, absolutely not. Bleach is a harsh chemical that will damage the nylon fibers of the paracord, weakening its strength and potentially causing it to break down. Always opt for mild soap and cool water.

**Q: How often should I clean my paracord?**
A: The frequency depends on usage. If you use your paracord frequently in dirty environments, clean it after each use. Otherwise, a thorough cleaning every few months should suffice.

**Q: Will washing paracord affect its strength?**
A: When done correctly – using mild soap, cool water, and air drying – washing paracord should *not* significantly affect its strength. Harsh chemicals and heat are the primary culprits for strength reduction.

**Q: Can I machine wash paracord?**
A: It’s generally not recommended. Machine washing can be too abrasive and may cause shrinkage or damage. Hand washing is the safest and most effective method.

**Q: What if my paracord smells even after washing?**
A: Try soaking it in a baking soda solution (1 tbsp per gallon of water) for several hours before rinsing and air drying. This can help neutralize lingering odors.



## Conclusion

Cleaning your paracord is a simple yet vital task for anyone who relies on this versatile material. By following these guidelines – from spot cleaning to deep washing and proper storage – you can ensure your paracord remains strong, reliable, and ready for whatever challenges you face. Remember to always use mild soap, cool water, and air dry to preserve the integrity of the nylon fibers. Keeping your paracord clean isn’t just about maintenance; it’s about investing in its longevity and your own safety. So, take the time to care for your lifeline, and it will serve you well for years to come.
