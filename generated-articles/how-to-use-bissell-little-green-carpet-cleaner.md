## Unleash the Power of Spotless: A Guide to Using Your Bissell Little Green

Is a stubborn stain ruining your carpet or upholstery? The Bissell Little Green carpet cleaner is a powerful, portable solution for tackling messes big and small. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to use your Little Green effectively, from setup to cleaning and maintenance. We’ll cover the best cleaning solutions, techniques for different surfaces, and how to keep your machine running smoothly. Let's dive in and get your home looking its best!

**Takeaway:**

*   Fill the clean tank with the appropriate cleaning solution and water.
*   Attach the correct cleaning tool for the surface you're cleaning.
*   Spray the solution, then use the suction to lift dirt and stains.
*   Empty and clean both tanks after each use for optimal performance.

**Quick Answer:** To use a Bissell Little Green, fill the clean tank with solution, attach the appropriate tool, spray the stained area, and use the trigger to suction up the dirt and liquid. Remember to empty and rinse both tanks after each use.

## 1. Getting Started: Setting Up Your Bissell Little Green

Before you can start tackling those tough stains, you need to get your Bissell Little Green ready to go. First, unpack the machine and familiarize yourself with its parts. You’ll find a clean water tank, a dirty water tank, a spray trigger, and various cleaning attachments.  Make sure you understand where each part goes and how it functions.  Proper setup is key to a successful cleaning experience.

Next, fill the clean water tank with the appropriate cleaning solution. Bissell recommends using their own formulas, but you can also use a mixture of warm water and white vinegar for a more natural approach. *Never* use soap or detergents, as these can damage the machine.  Finally, ensure the dirty water tank is securely in place.

## 2. Choosing the Right Cleaning Solution for Your Needs

Selecting the right cleaning solution is crucial for achieving the best results and protecting your surfaces. Bissell offers a range of formulas specifically designed for different types of messes and materials. For general carpet cleaning, their standard carpet cleaning solution works wonders. If you have pets, opt for a formula designed to eliminate pet stains and odors. 

Consider the surface you’re cleaning. For upholstery, a specialized upholstery cleaning solution is recommended to prevent damage or discoloration.  You might also consider using a solution designed for area rugs, as these can be more delicate.  Remember to always follow the manufacturer's instructions for dilution ratios.  If you're looking for a natural alternative, a solution of equal parts white vinegar and water can be effective for many stains.

## 3. Mastering the Cleaning Technique: Step-by-Step Guide

Now for the main event: cleaning! Start by testing the cleaning solution in an inconspicuous area to ensure it doesn't damage the fabric. Once you've confirmed it's safe, attach the appropriate cleaning tool to the Little Green.  The standard tool is great for carpets, while the crevice tool is perfect for tight spaces.

Spray the stained area with the cleaning solution, saturating the stain but avoiding over-wetting. Then, press the trigger on the Little Green to activate the suction. Slowly move the cleaning tool back and forth over the stain, allowing the machine to lift the dirt and liquid.  Repeat this process until the stain is gone.  For stubborn stains, you may need to apply more solution and repeat the suction process several times.

## 4. Beyond Carpets: Using Your Little Green on Upholstery & More

The Bissell Little Green isn't just for carpets! Its versatility makes it a fantastic tool for cleaning upholstery, car interiors, and even hard-to-reach areas. When cleaning upholstery, use the upholstery tool and a gentle cleaning solution. Be careful not to over-wet the fabric, as this can lead to mildew.

You can also use the Little Green to refresh car interiors, cleaning seats, floor mats, and even dashboards. The crevice tool is particularly useful for cleaning between car seats.  Interestingly, many people also wonder [can you use a carpet cleaner on a mattress](https://www.beacleaner.com/can-you-use-a-carpet-cleaner-on-a-mattress)?

## 5. Maintaining Your Bissell Little Green for Long-Lasting Performance

Regular maintenance is essential for keeping your Bissell Little Green in top condition. After each use, empty and rinse both the clean and dirty water tanks thoroughly. This prevents the buildup of mold and mildew.  Allow the tanks and attachments to air dry completely before storing the machine.

Periodically, you should also clean the brush head to remove any trapped debris.

Proper maintenance will ensure your Little Green continues to deliver powerful cleaning performance for years to come.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues with Your Little Green

Even with proper care, you might encounter a few issues with your Bissell Little Green. One common problem is reduced suction. This is often caused by a clogged filter or a full dirty water tank.  Another issue is the machine not turning on.  Check the power cord and ensure it's securely plugged in.

If the Little Green is leaking, inspect the tanks and hoses for any cracks or damage.  If you're still having trouble, consult the owner's manual or visit the Bissell website for troubleshooting tips.  Sometimes, a simple reset can resolve the issue.
