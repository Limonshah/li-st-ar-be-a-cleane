## Clearing the Way: How To Clean Out Underground Conduit

Have you noticed slow drainage or backups in your plumbing system? A clogged underground conduit could be the culprit. Dealing with blocked underground conduit isn’t something most homeowners tackle daily, but understanding the process can save you time and money. This article will walk you through everything you need to know about how to clean out underground conduit, from identifying the problem to choosing the right tools and techniques. We’ll cover safety precautions, different cleaning methods, and when it’s best to call a professional.

**Takeaway:**

*   Identify the blockage location.
*   Choose the appropriate cleaning method (snaking, hydro jetting, or chemical solutions).
*   Prioritize safety with proper protective gear.
*   Consider professional help for complex or persistent blockages.

**What is Underground Conduit and Why Does it Get Clogged?**

Underground conduit refers to the pipes that run beneath your property, carrying wastewater away from your home. These pipes are often made of PVC, clay, or cast iron. Over time, these conduits can become clogged due to a variety of reasons. Common culprits include tree roots infiltrating the pipes, buildup of grease and debris, and even accidental flushing of inappropriate items. Ignoring a blockage can lead to serious plumbing issues, including backups, leaks, and even structural damage.

### Identifying a Blocked Underground Conduit

Before you start digging or snaking, it’s important to confirm you’re dealing with a blocked underground conduit. Several signs can indicate a problem. Slow draining sinks, toilets, or showers are a common indicator. You might also notice gurgling sounds coming from your drains, or even sewage backups in your yard. If multiple drains are affected, the blockage is likely located in the main underground conduit line.

### Tools You’ll Need for Conduit Cleaning

Successfully cleaning out underground conduit requires having the right tools on hand. A plumbing snake, also known as an auger, is essential for breaking up and removing blockages. Different types of snakes are available, from manual hand-cranked models to powered versions. Hydro jetters use high-pressure water to blast away debris, and are effective for stubborn clogs. Finally, you’ll need safety gear like gloves, eye protection, and potentially a respirator, depending on the cleaning method.

### Cleaning with a Plumbing Snake (Auger)

Using a plumbing snake is a common and effective method for clearing underground conduit blockages. Start by locating the cleanout access point, usually a capped pipe near your foundation. Carefully remove the cap and insert the snake into the conduit. Rotate the handle as you push the snake forward, feeling for resistance. Once you encounter the blockage, continue rotating the snake to break it up or grab onto it. Slowly pull the snake back out, removing any debris. You may need to repeat this process several times to fully clear the conduit.

### Hydro Jetting: A Powerful Cleaning Solution

For more stubborn blockages, hydro jetting can be a powerful solution. This method uses high-pressure water to scour the inside of the conduit, removing grease, debris, and even tree roots. Hydro jetting is typically performed by a professional plumber, as it requires specialized equipment and expertise. While effective, it's important to ensure your conduit material can withstand the high pressure.

### Chemical Solutions: Use with Caution

While chemical drain cleaners are readily available, they should be used with extreme caution when dealing with underground conduit. These chemicals can corrode pipes, especially older ones, and pose environmental hazards. If you choose to use a chemical solution, follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully and avoid using harsh chemicals. Consider safer, more environmentally friendly alternatives like baking soda and vinegar. Remember, preventative maintenance is key, and regular cleaning can prevent the need for harsh chemicals.

### Safety First: Protecting Yourself During Conduit Cleaning

Cleaning out underground conduit can be a messy and potentially hazardous task. Always wear gloves and eye protection to protect yourself from bacteria and debris. If you’re using chemical solutions, wear a respirator to avoid inhaling fumes. Be careful when handling plumbing snakes, as they can cause injury if used improperly. Finally, be aware of the potential for sewage backups and take appropriate precautions to contain any spills.

### Preventing Future Blockages: Maintenance Tips

Once you’ve cleared the blockage, take steps to prevent future problems. Avoid flushing grease, oil, or other inappropriate items down your drains. Regularly flush your drains with hot water to help dissolve buildup. Consider installing drain screens to catch hair and debris. Finally, schedule regular plumbing inspections to identify and address potential issues before they become major problems.

### When to Call a Professional Plumber

While many conduit blockages can be handled by homeowners, some situations require professional help. If you’ve tried multiple methods and the blockage persists, it’s time to call a plumber. Similarly, if you suspect a broken or damaged conduit, a professional can assess the situation and recommend the appropriate repairs. Complex blockages, such as those caused by extensive tree root intrusion, also require specialized equipment and expertise. Don't hesitate to seek professional assistance to avoid further damage and ensure the job is done correctly.



## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How often should I clean my underground conduit?**

A: It depends on your location and usage, but generally, having your underground conduit inspected and cleaned every 1-3 years can prevent major blockages. Regular preventative maintenance is much cheaper than dealing with a full-blown backup.

**Q: Can tree roots really cause conduit blockages?**

A: Absolutely. Tree roots are a common cause of underground conduit blockages. They seek out moisture and can infiltrate cracks in the pipes, growing and expanding to create significant obstructions.

**Q: Is hydro jetting safe for all types of conduit?**

A: Not necessarily. Hydro jetting uses high-pressure water, which can damage older or fragile pipes. A professional plumber can assess your conduit material and determine if hydro jetting is a safe option.

**Q: What should I do if I experience a sewage backup in my yard?**

A: Immediately stop using water and contact a professional plumber. Sewage backups can pose a health hazard and require immediate attention.

**Q: Can I use a garbage disposal without worrying about conduit blockages?**

A: While garbage disposals are convenient, they can contribute to conduit blockages if used improperly. Avoid grinding fibrous materials like celery or banana peels, and always run plenty of water while the disposal is operating.
