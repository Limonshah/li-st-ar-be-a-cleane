## Revive Your View: How To Clean Speedometer Plastic

Is your speedometer looking cloudy, scratched, or just plain dirty? A clear speedometer is essential for safe driving, and thankfully, cleaning the plastic lens is often a simple DIY project. This guide will show you how to clean speedometer plastic effectively, restoring its clarity and protecting it from further damage. We’ll cover everything from gentle cleaning solutions to tackling stubborn grime, ensuring you can easily see your speed. Let's get started on bringing back that crisp, clear view!

**Takeaway:**

*   Use a microfiber cloth and mild soap for regular cleaning.
*   Avoid abrasive cleaners that can scratch the plastic.
*   Protect the plastic with a UV protectant after cleaning.
*   For deeper scratches, consider plastic polishing compounds.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean speedometer plastic, gently wipe the lens with a microfiber cloth dampened with a solution of mild dish soap and warm water. Rinse with clean water and dry thoroughly. Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive materials to prevent scratches and maintain clarity.

## Understanding Speedometer Plastic & Potential Issues

Speedometer lenses are typically made from acrylic or polycarbonate plastic. These materials are durable, but they are susceptible to scratches, fading, and clouding over time. Exposure to sunlight, heat, and regular cleaning with harsh chemicals can accelerate these issues. Understanding the type of plastic helps you choose the right cleaning method. Acrylic is softer and scratches more easily than polycarbonate. Knowing this will help you avoid damaging your speedometer during the cleaning process. Regular cleaning prevents buildup and keeps your speedometer looking its best.

## Gentle Cleaning: The First Line of Defense

For routine maintenance, a gentle cleaning approach is best. This prevents scratches and keeps the plastic clear. Start by dusting the speedometer with a soft, dry microfiber cloth to remove loose dirt and debris. Next, mix a small amount of mild dish soap with warm water. Dampen a clean microfiber cloth with the soapy water – *do not* saturate it. Gently wipe the speedometer plastic in circular motions. Rinse the cloth with clean water and wipe the lens again to remove any soap residue. Finally, dry the speedometer with a separate, clean, dry microfiber cloth. This simple process can make a big difference in maintaining clarity.

## Tackling Stubborn Grime & Fingerprints

Sometimes, a simple soap and water solution isn’t enough. Stubborn grime, fingerprints, and road film can require a bit more effort. For these situations, consider using a dedicated plastic cleaner. These cleaners are formulated to safely remove dirt and grime without damaging the plastic. Apply a small amount of the cleaner to a microfiber cloth and gently wipe the speedometer lens. Avoid spraying the cleaner directly onto the speedometer, as this can cause it to seep into the instrument cluster. If you're dealing with particularly sticky residue, let the cleaner sit for a minute or two before wiping it away.

### Dealing with Haze and Cloudiness

Cloudiness often develops over time due to oxidation and UV exposure. A plastic polish can help restore clarity. Apply a small amount of plastic polish to a clean microfiber cloth and gently rub it onto the speedometer lens in circular motions. Use light pressure and avoid applying too much polish. Buff the lens with a clean, dry microfiber cloth until it’s clear and shiny.

## Removing Scratches: A Step-by-Step Guide

Minor scratches can be minimized with a plastic polishing compound. These compounds contain fine abrasives that gently smooth out the surface of the plastic. Start by cleaning the speedometer lens thoroughly, as described above. Apply a small amount of polishing compound to a clean microfiber cloth. Gently rub the compound onto the scratched area in circular motions. Use light pressure and work in small sections. After polishing, wipe away any residue with a clean microfiber cloth. Repeat the process if necessary, but avoid over-polishing, as this can damage the plastic. For more extensive scratch removal, professional detailing may be required.

## Protecting Your Work: UV Protection is Key

Once you’ve cleaned and polished your speedometer plastic, it’s important to protect it from future damage. UV rays can cause fading, clouding, and cracking. Apply a UV protectant specifically designed for plastic. This will create a barrier against the sun’s harmful rays. Apply the protectant to a clean microfiber cloth and wipe it onto the speedometer lens. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for application and reapplication frequency. Regularly applying UV protectant will help keep your speedometer looking new for years to come.

## What *Not* To Do: Avoiding Common Mistakes

Certain cleaning methods can actually damage your speedometer plastic. Avoid using abrasive cleaners, such as scouring powders or steel wool. These will scratch the plastic and make it even more cloudy. Also, avoid using harsh chemicals, such as ammonia or bleach. These can discolor the plastic and cause it to become brittle. Never spray cleaning solutions directly onto the speedometer, as this can cause them to seep into the instrument cluster. Always apply the cleaner to a microfiber cloth first. Finally, avoid using paper towels, as they can leave behind lint and scratches.
