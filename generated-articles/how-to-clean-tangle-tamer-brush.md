## How To Clean Your Tangle Tamer Brush for Healthy Hair

Is your Tangle Tamer brush looking a little worse for wear? Don't worry, it happens! Hair, product buildup, and everyday grime can quickly accumulate, making your brush less effective and potentially transferring dirt back into your hair. Cleaning your Tangle Tamer brush regularly is essential for maintaining good hair hygiene and keeping your brush in top condition. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to clean your brush quickly and efficiently.

**Takeaway:**

*   Remove loose hair regularly.
*   Wash the brush with mild soap and water.
*   Dry the brush thoroughly before use.
*   Disinfect occasionally for optimal hygiene.

**Quick Answer:** To clean a Tangle Tamer brush, remove loose hair, wash it with warm water and a gentle shampoo, rinse thoroughly, and allow it to air dry completely. This simple process keeps your brush hygienic and effective.

## Why Cleaning Your Tangle Tamer Brush Matters

You might be wondering, is cleaning a hairbrush *really* that important? The answer is yes! Your Tangle Tamer brush collects more than just loose strands. It gathers hairspray residue, styling products, oils, dust, and even dead skin cells. Leaving these things to accumulate can create a breeding ground for bacteria.  A dirty brush can transfer these impurities back into your hair, potentially causing scalp irritation or even hindering hair growth.  Regular cleaning ensures a healthier scalp and happier hair.

## Gathering Your Supplies for a Deep Clean

Before you begin, gather everything you’ll need. This makes the process quick and easy. You won’t need anything fancy – most of these items you likely already have at home. Here’s what you’ll need:

*   A comb or brush cleaning tool (optional, but helpful)
*   Warm water
*   Mild shampoo or dish soap
*   A soft toothbrush (an old one works perfectly)
*   A clean towel

Having these supplies ready will streamline the cleaning process and ensure you get the best results.  Don't underestimate the power of a clean brush!

## Removing Loose Hair: The First Step

The first step in cleaning your Tangle Tamer brush is removing all the loose hair. This is arguably the most tedious part, but it’s crucial. You can use your fingers, a comb, or a specialized brush cleaning tool. Many tools are designed to grab and pull hair from the bristles.  Start at the base of the bristles and work your way towards the tips.  Dispose of the collected hair immediately.  Removing the bulk of the hair before washing makes the rest of the process much easier.

## Washing Your Tangle Tamer Brush: A Gentle Approach

Now it’s time to wash your brush. Fill a sink or bowl with warm water and add a small amount of mild shampoo or dish soap. Gently swirl the brush bristles in the soapy water, being careful not to get the handle wet if it contains electronics (some Tangle Tamers have ionic technology).  Use a soft toothbrush to scrub between the bristles, removing any remaining product buildup. Pay attention to the base of the bristles where dirt tends to accumulate.  Rinse the brush thoroughly under warm running water until all the soap is gone.  Ensure no soapy residue remains, as this can leave your hair feeling sticky.

## Drying Your Brush Properly: Preventing Damage

Proper drying is just as important as washing. Never use a hairdryer to dry your Tangle Tamer brush, as the heat can damage the bristles and potentially melt any plastic components. Gently shake off excess water and lay the brush flat on a clean towel, with the bristles facing down. This allows air to circulate and prevents water from seeping into the handle.  Allow the brush to air dry completely before using it. This could take several hours, or even overnight.  Using a damp brush can promote bacterial growth and damage your hair.

## Disinfecting Your Brush: An Extra Layer of Clean

For an extra layer of hygiene, you can occasionally disinfect your Tangle Tamer brush.  Mix a solution of equal parts water and rubbing alcohol. Dip a clean cloth into the solution and wipe down the bristles and handle.  Avoid getting the solution on any electronic components.  Allow the brush to air dry completely before using it. Disinfecting helps kill any remaining bacteria and keeps your brush fresh and clean.
