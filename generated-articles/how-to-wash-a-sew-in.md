## How to Wash a Sew In: A Complete Guide

Have you invested in a beautiful sew-in weave, but are now wondering about the best way to keep it clean and healthy? Washing a sew-in is different than washing your natural hair, and doing it incorrectly can lead to matting, mildew, and even scalp issues. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to properly wash your sew-in, keeping both your hair and weave looking fabulous. We’ll cover preparation, the washing process itself, conditioning, and drying – ensuring your sew-in stays fresh and flawless.

**Takeaway:**

*   Pre-treat your scalp with oil.
*   Use sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner.
*   Focus on cleaning the scalp and weave tracks.
*   Rinse thoroughly to avoid product buildup.
*   Dry completely to prevent mildew.

**Can you wash a sew in?**

Yes, you absolutely can and *should* wash your sew-in! Regular washing (every 1-2 weeks) is crucial for maintaining a healthy scalp and preventing buildup on the weave. A clean sew-in looks better and lasts longer.

## Preparing to Wash Your Sew In

Before you even step into the shower, preparation is key. This step ensures a smooth and effective wash day. Start by detangling the weave gently with a wide-tooth comb, focusing on the ends. Next, apply a light oil (like jojoba or coconut oil) directly to your scalp. This helps to loosen any buildup and moisturize your skin, preventing dryness and itchiness.  Finally, gently separate the weave tracks to allow water and shampoo to reach the scalp.

## Choosing the Right Products for Your Sew In

Selecting the right products is vital for the health of both your natural hair and the weave. Avoid shampoos containing sulfates, as these can strip moisture from the hair and cause dryness. Instead, opt for a sulfate-free shampoo specifically designed for extensions or color-treated hair.  A moisturizing conditioner is also essential to replenish lost moisture and keep the weave soft and manageable.  Consider a leave-in conditioner for added hydration.

## The Washing Process: Step-by-Step

Now for the main event! Wet your hair thoroughly, ensuring the weave is completely saturated.  Gently massage the sulfate-free shampoo into your scalp using your fingertips, focusing on removing dirt and buildup. Avoid vigorous scrubbing, as this can cause tangling.  Work the shampoo down the weave tracks, but avoid rubbing the hair together, which can lead to matting.  Once you've thoroughly cleansed your scalp and weave, rinse completely with lukewarm water.  Make sure all the shampoo is removed, as residue can attract dirt and cause itching.

## Conditioning Your Sew In for Softness & Shine

After rinsing out the shampoo, apply a generous amount of moisturizing conditioner to the weave, focusing on the ends. Detangle the weave again with a wide-tooth comb while the conditioner is still in your hair. This helps to smooth the hair and prevent breakage. Leave the conditioner on for 5-10 minutes to allow it to penetrate the hair shaft.  For a deeper conditioning treatment, you can use a plastic cap to trap heat.  Rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water until the conditioner is completely removed.

## Drying Your Sew In Properly

Drying your sew-in correctly is crucial to prevent mildew and maintain the integrity of the weave.  Gently squeeze out excess water with a microfiber towel – avoid rubbing, as this can cause frizz.  Allow the weave to air dry as much as possible. You can sit under a hooded dryer on a low heat setting to speed up the process, but avoid high heat, which can damage the hair.  Ensure the weave is *completely* dry before going to bed, as moisture trapped underneath can lead to mildew growth.  Consider using a cool-shot setting on your hairdryer to finish drying the roots.

## Maintaining Your Sew In Between Washes

To keep your sew-in looking its best between washes, incorporate a few simple maintenance steps into your routine.  Use a silk or satin scarf or bonnet at night to protect the weave from friction and tangling.  Apply a light oil to your scalp as needed to prevent dryness and itching.  Avoid using heavy styling products that can cause buildup.  Gently detangle the weave daily with a wide-tooth comb.  You can also use a weave refresher spray to revitalize the hair and add shine.
