## Tackling That Sticky Situation: Cleaning Your GM Steering Wheel

Have you noticed your General Motors (GM) steering wheel feels…well, sticky? It’s a surprisingly common problem, affecting many GM vehicles from the late 90s through the 2010s. This isn't just a cosmetic issue; a sticky steering wheel can be uncomfortable and even affect your grip. Fortunately, you don’t need a professional detailer to fix it. This guide will walk you through several effective methods to clean your sticky GM steering wheel and restore it to a comfortable, non-sticky finish. We’ll cover everything from simple cleaning solutions to more involved restoration techniques.

**Takeaway:**

*   Identify the cause of the stickiness (polyurethane breakdown).
*   Start with gentle cleaners like dish soap and water.
*   For stubborn stickiness, use isopropyl alcohol or specialized cleaners.
*   Protect your steering wheel with a UV protectant after cleaning.

**What Causes GM Steering Wheels to Get Sticky?**

The primary culprit is the polyurethane coating used on many GM steering wheels. Over time, this coating breaks down due to exposure to sunlight, heat, body oils, and cleaning products. This breakdown creates a tacky, sticky residue that’s difficult to remove. It’s not dirt; it’s the coating *itself* deteriorating. Understanding this is key to choosing the right cleaning method.

## Step 1: The Gentle Approach – Soap and Water

Let's start with the least abrasive method. Often, a simple cleaning can remove surface grime contributing to the sticky feel. Mix a small amount of mild dish soap with warm water. Dip a microfiber cloth into the solution, wring it out thoroughly (you don’t want a soaking wet cloth!), and gently wipe down the steering wheel.  Follow up with a clean, damp cloth to remove any soap residue, and then dry with another clean microfiber cloth. This is a good starting point for light stickiness and regular maintenance. If you're looking to keep your steering wheel in top shape, consider checking out guides on how to clean a [steering wheel cover](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-steering-wheel-cover) for added protection.

## Step 2: Stepping It Up – Isopropyl Alcohol

If soap and water aren’t cutting it, isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol) is your next best bet.  It’s a stronger solvent that can help dissolve the broken-down polyurethane.  Pour a small amount of 70% or 91% isopropyl alcohol onto a clean microfiber cloth. Gently wipe the steering wheel in sections, applying light pressure.  Avoid letting the alcohol pool on the surface.  Immediately follow with a clean, damp cloth to remove the alcohol residue, and then dry with a clean microfiber cloth.  Be cautious, as alcohol can dry out the surrounding vinyl and plastic, so avoid excessive use on those surfaces.

## Step 3: Specialized Steering Wheel Cleaners

For a more targeted approach, consider using a steering wheel cleaner specifically designed for polyurethane. These cleaners often contain ingredients that help break down the sticky residue without damaging the material. Follow the product instructions carefully.  These cleaners are often more expensive than isopropyl alcohol, but they can be more effective and gentler on the steering wheel’s surface.  Always test the cleaner in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t cause discoloration or damage.

## Step 4: Deep Cleaning with Adhesive Remover (Use with Caution!)

If the stickiness is severe, you might consider using an adhesive remover like Goo Gone. *However, use this as a last resort and with extreme caution.* Adhesive removers are strong solvents and can potentially damage the steering wheel’s finish. Apply a very small amount to a microfiber cloth and gently wipe the sticky areas. Immediately wipe away the adhesive remover with a clean, damp cloth, and then dry thoroughly.  This method requires careful testing and monitoring to avoid any adverse effects.  If you have an Alcantara steering wheel, do *not* use adhesive remover; instead, explore methods for cleaning an [alcantara steering wheel](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-an-alcantara-steering-wheel).

## Step 5: Protecting Your Investment – UV Protectant

Once you’ve cleaned your steering wheel, it’s crucial to protect it from further breakdown. Apply a UV protectant specifically designed for automotive interiors. This will help shield the polyurethane from the damaging effects of sunlight and heat, slowing down the deterioration process.  Apply the protectant according to the product instructions, and reapply every few months for optimal protection.  A good UV protectant will not only help prevent future stickiness but also keep your steering wheel looking its best.

## FAQ: Common Questions About Sticky GM Steering Wheels

**Q: Why are GM steering wheels particularly prone to this stickiness?**

A: GM used a specific type of polyurethane coating on many of their steering wheels that is known to break down over time. This breakdown is accelerated by heat, sunlight, and exposure to oils from your skin. It’s a material flaw, unfortunately, and not a result of improper cleaning.

**Q: Can I just cover the steering wheel with a cover?**

A: While a [fabric steering wheel cover](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-fabric-steering-wheel-cover) can provide a temporary solution and improve grip, it doesn’t address the underlying issue. The stickiness will continue to worsen underneath the cover.

**Q: Will any cleaning product work?**

A: No. Abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals can damage the steering wheel’s finish. Stick to the methods outlined above, starting with the gentlest options.

**Q: How often should I clean my steering wheel?**

A: Regular cleaning, even just a quick wipe-down with a damp microfiber cloth, can help prevent the buildup of grime and oils that contribute to stickiness. Aim to clean it at least once a month, or more frequently if you live in a hot, sunny climate.

**Q: Is there a permanent fix for a severely sticky steering wheel?**

A: Unfortunately, there isn’t a permanent fix. You can clean and restore the steering wheel, but the polyurethane will eventually break down again. Some people opt for a steering wheel wrap or replacement, but these are more expensive options.



## Conclusion: Keeping Your Grip – and Your Sanity

Dealing with a sticky GM steering wheel can be frustrating, but it’s a problem you can tackle yourself. By understanding the cause of the stickiness and following the steps outlined in this guide, you can effectively clean and restore your steering wheel. Remember to start with the gentlest methods and work your way up as needed.  Don’t forget the importance of protecting your investment with a UV protectant to prevent future deterioration. A clean, comfortable steering wheel makes for a more enjoyable driving experience, so take the time to address this common GM issue.
