## Revitalize Your Pool: How to Clean an Above Ground Pool Pump Impeller

Is your above ground pool’s water looking cloudy, or does it seem like the circulation isn’t as strong as it used to be? A clogged **pool pump impeller** is often the culprit. Don't worry, cleaning it is a straightforward DIY project that can save you money and get your pool sparkling again. This article will walk you through everything you need to know about cleaning your above ground pool pump impeller, ensuring efficient water flow and a healthier swimming environment. We’ll cover identifying issues, the tools you’ll need, step-by-step cleaning instructions, and preventative measures to keep your impeller running smoothly.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly inspect your impeller for debris.
*   Turn off power before any maintenance.
*   Carefully remove and clean the impeller and housing.
*   Reassemble correctly and test for improved flow.

A clean impeller is crucial for a healthy pool. It’s the component responsible for creating suction and circulating water throughout your filtration system. When debris like leaves, hair, and small objects get lodged in the impeller, it restricts water flow, reducing the pump’s efficiency and potentially damaging the motor. 

### Why is a Clean Impeller Important?

A functioning impeller directly impacts your pool’s overall health. Reduced water flow means less effective filtration, leading to cloudy water and algae growth.  A struggling pump also works harder, shortening its lifespan and potentially leading to costly repairs or replacements.  Keeping your impeller clean is a simple preventative measure that can save you significant time and money in the long run.  Regular maintenance, like checking your [how-often-to-clean-pool-pump-basket](https://beacleaner.com/how-often-to-clean-pool-pump-basket), can also help prevent impeller clogs.

### Identifying a Clogged Impeller

Recognizing the signs of a clogged impeller is the first step to resolving the issue.  Reduced water flow is the most obvious indicator; you might notice weaker suction from the skimmer or returns.  Another sign is a rattling or grinding noise coming from the pump, which suggests debris is interfering with the impeller’s rotation.  Finally, if your filter pressure is unusually high, it could be a sign that the pump isn’t circulating water effectively due to an obstruction in the impeller.

### Tools You’ll Need for the Job

Before you begin, gather the necessary tools to make the process smooth and efficient. You’ll need a screwdriver (likely Phillips head), pliers, a small bucket or container, and potentially a flashlight for better visibility.  Having some lubricant, like silicone grease, can also be helpful for reassembly.  Most importantly, ensure you have a way to safely disconnect the power to the pump before starting any work.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Your Pool Pump Impeller

Now, let's get to the cleaning process. Remember to prioritize safety by disconnecting the power to the pump before you begin.

1.  **Turn Off the Power:**  This is the most important step! Locate the circuit breaker that controls the pool pump and switch it off. Double-check that the pump is completely powered down.
2.  **Access the Impeller Housing:**  Remove the pump lid or cover, usually secured with screws.  Refer to your pump’s manual if you’re unsure how to access the impeller housing.
3.  **Remove the Impeller:**  The impeller is typically held in place by a retaining nut or screw. Use pliers or a screwdriver to carefully remove it.  Note the orientation of the impeller for reassembly.
4.  **Inspect and Clean:**  Once the impeller is removed, inspect it for any debris like leaves, hair, or small objects.  Carefully remove any obstructions by hand or with pliers.  Also, inspect the impeller housing for any buildup or blockages and clean it thoroughly.
5.  **Reassemble:**  Once everything is clean, carefully reinsert the impeller into the housing, ensuring it’s oriented correctly.  Secure it with the retaining nut or screw.
6.  **Restore Power and Test:**  Replace the pump lid or cover and reconnect the power.  Turn on the pump and observe the water flow. You should notice a significant improvement in circulation. If you're still having issues, consider checking your [how-often-should-you-clean-the-pool-filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-often-should-you-clean-the-pool-filter) as well.

### Preventing Future Impeller Clogs

Cleaning your impeller is a reactive measure, but you can take steps to prevent clogs from occurring in the first place. Regularly cleaning your pool skimmer and pump basket is crucial. These components catch larger debris before it reaches the impeller.  Consider using a leaf net to remove leaves and other debris from the pool surface before they sink and get sucked into the filtration system.  Also, ensure your pool is properly covered when not in use to minimize debris accumulation.

### Dealing with a Stuck Impeller

Sometimes, the impeller can become stuck due to corrosion or a particularly stubborn blockage.  If you encounter a stuck impeller, avoid forcing it, as this could damage the pump.  Try gently rocking the impeller back and forth to loosen it.  If it remains stuck, you may need to apply a penetrating oil or lubricant to help dissolve any corrosion.  If you’re unable to free the impeller, it’s best to consult a pool professional.

### When to Call a Professional

While cleaning your pool pump impeller is typically a DIY-friendly task, there are situations where it’s best to call a professional. If you’re uncomfortable working with electrical components, or if you suspect there’s damage to the pump motor, it’s always safer to seek expert assistance.  Similarly, if you’ve cleaned the impeller and the pump still isn’t functioning correctly, there may be a more serious underlying issue that requires professional diagnosis and repair.



### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How often should I clean my pool pump impeller?**
A:  It depends on your pool’s environment and usage, but generally, you should inspect and clean your impeller at least once a year, or more frequently if you notice reduced water flow or other signs of a clog.

**Q: Can I use any type of lubricant when reassembling the impeller?**
A: Silicone-based lubricant is recommended as it’s safe for use with pool equipment and won’t degrade the impeller material.

**Q: What if I can’t remove the impeller retaining nut?**
A:  Try using a penetrating oil to loosen the nut. If that doesn’t work, you may need a specialized wrench or the assistance of a pool professional.

**Q: Will a clogged impeller damage my pool pump motor?**
A: Yes, a severely clogged impeller can cause the pump motor to overheat and potentially fail. Regular cleaning is essential to prevent this.

**Q: Is it normal for my pump to make some noise?**
A: A little noise is normal, but loud rattling or grinding sounds usually indicate a problem, such as a clogged impeller or worn bearings.
