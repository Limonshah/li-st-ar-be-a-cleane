## How To Clean A Spoolie: A Simple Guide

Have you ever thought about how often you *really* clean your spoolie? These little brushes are essential for everything from taming eyebrows to separating lashes, but they can quickly become breeding grounds for bacteria. A clean spoolie isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about your skin health too! This article will walk you through everything you need to know about how to clean a spoolie, ensuring it stays in top condition and keeps your makeup routine hygienic. We’ll cover different cleaning methods, how often to clean, and tips for extending the life of your favorite spoolies.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning prevents bacteria buildup.
*   Gentle cleansers are best for preserving spoolie shape.
*   Proper drying is crucial to avoid damage.
*   Cleaning extends the lifespan of your spoolies.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean a spoolie, gently wash it with mild soap and water, rinse thoroughly, and allow it to air dry bristles-down. This removes makeup residue and bacteria, keeping your tools hygienic and extending their lifespan.

## Why Cleaning Your Spoolie Matters

Let's face it, we often overlook cleaning our smaller makeup tools. But your spoolie accumulates product buildup, dead skin cells, and bacteria with each use. This can lead to breakouts, irritation, and even eye infections. Think about it – you’re applying this directly to sensitive areas of your face! Regularly cleaning your spoolie is a simple step that can make a big difference in your skin’s health. It’s a small investment of time for a significant return in hygiene and peace of mind. 

## Gathering Your Supplies for Spoolie Cleaning

Before you begin, gather everything you’ll need. You don’t need a lot! Keeping these items handy will make the process quick and easy. Here’s a checklist:

*   **Mild Soap:** Baby shampoo or a gentle facial cleanser works best. Avoid harsh soaps that can damage the bristles.
*   **Lukewarm Water:** Hot water can melt glue and distort the spoolie’s shape.
*   **Clean Towel:** For gently removing excess water.
*   **Cleaning Mat (Optional):** These textured mats help loosen debris.
*   **Brush Cleaning Solution (Optional):** Specifically designed for brushes, but not essential.

## The Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Your Spoolie

Now, let's get down to the actual cleaning process. It’s surprisingly straightforward! Follow these steps for a sparkling clean spoolie:

1.  **Wet the Bristles:** Hold the spoolie bristles-down under lukewarm running water. Avoid getting water on the handle, especially if it’s wooden.
2.  **Apply Soap:** Place a small amount of mild soap into your palm. Gently swirl the spoolie bristles in the soap to create a lather.
3.  **Cleanse the Bristles:** Using gentle circular motions, work the soapy water through the bristles. A cleaning mat can be helpful here to dislodge stubborn product.
4.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse the spoolie under lukewarm water until all traces of soap are gone. Squeeze the bristles gently to remove excess water.
5.  **Reshape and Dry:** Gently reshape the bristles with your fingers. Place the spoolie bristles-down on a clean towel to air dry. This prevents water from seeping into the handle.

## Different Cleaning Methods for Your Spoolie

While the method above is a great all-around approach, there are a few variations you can try. Sometimes, you might need a little extra cleaning power!

*   **Deep Cleaning with Oil:** For stubborn mascara or gel buildup, use a makeup remover oil. Apply a small amount to the bristles, gently massage, and then follow with the soap and water method.
*   **Using a Brush Cleaning Solution:** If you prefer a dedicated brush cleaner, follow the product’s instructions. These solutions are often formulated to effectively remove makeup and bacteria.
*   **DIY Cleaning Solution:** Mix a few drops of tea tree oil (known for its antibacterial properties) with water for a natural cleaning solution.

## How Often Should You Clean Your Spoolie?

The frequency of cleaning depends on how often you use your spoolie. However, a good rule of thumb is to clean it at least once a week. If you use it daily, especially for mascara, consider cleaning it more frequently – even after each use. This prevents bacteria from accumulating and keeps your eyes healthy. Think of it like washing your hands – regular cleaning is key! For less frequently used spoolies, a monthly cleaning should suffice.

## Extending the Life of Your Spoolie

Cleaning is important, but so is proper care. Here are a few tips to help your spoolie last longer:

*   **Store Properly:** Store your spoolie in a clean, dry place. A brush holder or makeup bag is ideal.
*   **Avoid Excessive Water:** As mentioned earlier, avoid getting water on the handle, especially if it’s wood.
*   **Gentle Handling:** Be gentle when cleaning and drying your spoolie. Avoid pulling or tugging on the bristles.
*   **Replace When Necessary:** Even with proper care, spoolies will eventually wear out. Replace your spoolie when the bristles become bent, frayed, or difficult to clean.



## Frequently Asked Questions About Spoolie Cleaning

*   **Can I use hand soap to clean my spoolie?** While you *can* use hand soap in a pinch, it’s best to use a mild soap like baby shampoo or a gentle facial cleanser. Hand soap can be drying and potentially irritating to the skin.
*   **How do I dry my spoolie quickly?** Avoid using a hairdryer, as the heat can damage the bristles. Air drying is the safest method. Ensure it’s bristles-down to prevent water from entering the handle.
*   **What if my spoolie is glued together and the glue is dissolving?** This is usually caused by hot water. Always use lukewarm water when cleaning.
*   **Can I sanitize my spoolie with alcohol?** While alcohol is a disinfectant, it can dry out and damage the bristles. It’s best to stick to mild soap and water.
*   **Is it okay to share a spoolie?** Absolutely not! Sharing a spoolie can spread bacteria and lead to infections.
