## Keeping Your White Rothys Sparkling Clean

White shoes are a classic, but keeping them clean can feel like a constant battle. If you love your white Rothys, you know the struggle is real! Luckily, maintaining their pristine look isn’t as difficult as you might think. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to clean your white Rothys and keep them looking their best. We’ll cover everything from quick daily touch-ups to tackling stubborn stains, ensuring your favorite shoes stay fresh and stylish.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly wipe down your Rothys with a damp cloth.
*   Use a mild soap and water solution for deeper cleaning.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive cleaners.
*   Air dry your Rothys completely after cleaning.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean white Rothys, gently wipe away dirt with a damp cloth. For tougher stains, mix mild soap with water, scrub lightly with a soft brush, and rinse thoroughly. Always air dry, avoiding direct heat, to maintain the shoe’s shape and material integrity.

## Understanding Your Rothys Material

Before diving into cleaning, it’s important to understand what your Rothys are made of. Rothys are primarily constructed from recycled plastic bottles, creating a unique knit fabric. This material is surprisingly durable, but it also requires specific care. Unlike leather or canvas, the knit structure can trap dirt and debris, making regular cleaning essential. Knowing this helps you choose the right cleaning methods and avoid damaging your shoes.

## Daily Maintenance for White Rothys

Preventative care is the best way to keep your white Rothys looking new. A little effort each day can save you a lot of work later. After each wear, take a moment to wipe down your shoes with a damp cloth. This removes surface dirt and prevents it from becoming embedded in the knit. You can also use a soft brush, like an old toothbrush, to gently scrub away any loose debris. 

Consider using a protective spray designed for knit fabrics. This can help repel water and stains, making your Rothys even easier to maintain. Remember, consistent small actions are more effective than infrequent deep cleans.

## Deep Cleaning Your White Rothys

Sometimes, a simple wipe-down isn’t enough. For more thorough cleaning, you’ll need a few basic supplies. Gather a bowl of lukewarm water, a mild soap (like dish soap or laundry detergent), a soft brush, and a clean cloth. 

Here’s how to deep clean your white Rothys:

1.  **Prepare the Solution:** Mix a small amount of soap with the lukewarm water.
2.  **Apply to Shoes:** Dip the soft brush into the soapy water and gently scrub the surface of your Rothys. Focus on areas with visible dirt or stains.
3.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe away the soap residue. Avoid soaking the shoes.
4.  **Air Dry:** Allow your Rothys to air dry completely, away from direct sunlight or heat. Stuffing them with paper towels can help maintain their shape.

## Tackling Stubborn Stains on White Rothys

Even with regular cleaning, stubborn stains can happen. Don’t panic! Here are a few methods for tackling common stains:

*   **Scuff Marks:** A magic eraser can often remove scuff marks from the rubber sole. Gently rub the eraser over the scuff until it disappears.
*   **Mud:** Let the mud dry completely, then brush it off with a soft brush. If any residue remains, use the mild soap and water solution described above.
*   **Grease:** Sprinkle baking soda on the grease stain and let it sit for 30 minutes. Then, brush off the baking soda and clean the area with mild soap and water.
*   **Ink:** Dab the ink stain with rubbing alcohol using a cotton swab. Blot gently, avoiding spreading the ink.

If you're dealing with stains on other white items, like a [white bag](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-white-bag), similar gentle cleaning methods often apply.

## Cleaning the Rothys Inserts

Don't forget about the inserts! Rothys inserts are removable and can be cleaned separately. Remove the inserts from your shoes and hand wash them with mild soap and water. Rinse thoroughly and allow them to air dry completely before placing them back into your Rothys. 

Regularly cleaning the inserts helps prevent odor and keeps your shoes feeling fresh. You can find more specific instructions on [how to clean Rothys inserts](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-rothys-inserts) on our website.

## What *Not* To Do When Cleaning White Rothys

Just as important as knowing what *to* do is knowing what *not* to do. Avoid these common cleaning mistakes:

*   **Harsh Chemicals:** Bleach, ammonia, and other harsh chemicals can damage the knit fabric and discolor your shoes.
*   **Abrasive Cleaners:** Scrubbing brushes and abrasive cleaners can also damage the material.
*   **Washing Machine:** While tempting, avoid putting your Rothys in the washing machine. The agitation can damage the shape and structure of the shoes.
*   **Direct Heat:** Do not use a hairdryer or place your Rothys in direct sunlight to dry. This can cause the material to shrink or warp.
