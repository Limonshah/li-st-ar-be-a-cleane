## Honda Lawn Mower Revving Up And Down: What’s Happening?

Have you noticed your Honda lawn mower surging in speed, then slowing down, almost on its own? This frustrating issue – your Honda lawn mower revving up and down – is surprisingly common. It disrupts your mowing and can indicate a deeper problem if left unchecked. This article will walk you through the most likely causes of this erratic behavior, and provide you with practical steps to diagnose and fix it. We’ll cover everything from simple air filter checks to more involved carburetor cleaning. Let's get your lawn mowing experience back on track!

**Takeaway:**

*   Check and replace the air filter.
*   Inspect and clean the carburetor.
*   Ensure proper fuel flow and fresh gasoline.
*   Look for vacuum leaks.

**Quick Answer:** A Honda lawn mower revving up and down usually points to a fuel delivery problem, a dirty air filter, or a carburetor issue. Addressing these areas will often resolve the problem and restore consistent engine performance.

## 1. The Dirty Air Filter: A Common Culprit

A clogged air filter is one of the most frequent reasons for a Honda lawn mower to surge or fluctuate in RPM. The air filter’s job is to keep dust and debris out of the engine. When it’s dirty, it restricts airflow, creating an imbalance in the fuel-air mixture. This imbalance causes the engine to hunt for the right mixture, resulting in the revving up and down. 

Regularly checking and cleaning or replacing your air filter is a simple maintenance task that can prevent a lot of headaches. You can easily access the air filter housing on most Honda mowers. If it’s just dusty, you can try gently tapping it to remove loose debris. However, if it’s heavily soiled, it’s best to replace it.

## 2. Carburetor Concerns: Fuel Mixture Imbalance

The carburetor is responsible for mixing air and fuel in the correct ratio for combustion. If the carburetor is dirty or malfunctioning, it can cause an inconsistent fuel mixture, leading to the surging issue.  Dirt, old fuel residue, or varnish can build up inside the carburetor, obstructing fuel flow and disrupting the proper air-fuel ratio. 

You might notice the problem is worse when the engine is cold, as the carburetor struggles to compensate for the changing temperature. Cleaning the carburetor can often resolve this. You can try a carburetor cleaner spray, or for a more thorough cleaning, you might need to disassemble it.  If you're unsure about this process, consider consulting a professional.

### 2.1. Checking the Carburetor Float

Within the carburetor, the float regulates the fuel level. A stuck or damaged float can cause too much or too little fuel to enter the carburetor. This directly impacts the fuel-air mixture and can lead to surging. Inspect the float for any signs of damage or sticking. Gently move it to ensure it moves freely.

## 3. Fuel System Issues: Old Gas and Blockages

Old or contaminated gasoline can wreak havoc on your lawn mower’s engine. Gasoline degrades over time, especially when left sitting in the tank for extended periods. This degraded fuel can form gum and varnish, clogging fuel lines and jets within the carburetor.  Always use fresh gasoline and consider adding a fuel stabilizer, especially if you store your mower for long periods.

Another potential issue is a blocked fuel filter. The fuel filter prevents debris from reaching the carburetor. A clogged filter restricts fuel flow, causing the engine to run lean and surge.  Replace the fuel filter annually, or more often if you use your mower frequently.

## 4. Vacuum Leaks: Unintentional Air Intake

Vacuum leaks can introduce extra air into the engine, disrupting the fuel-air mixture. These leaks can occur around the carburetor, intake manifold, or any other vacuum-operated component.  Even a small leak can cause significant performance issues, including surging. 

Inspect all vacuum hoses for cracks, holes, or loose connections. You can often detect a vacuum leak by spraying a small amount of carburetor cleaner around the suspected area while the engine is running. If the engine speed changes, you’ve likely found a leak.

## 5. Spark Plug Problems: Weak Ignition

While less common, a faulty spark plug can contribute to an uneven engine performance. A worn or fouled spark plug may not consistently ignite the fuel-air mixture, leading to misfires and surging. Inspect the spark plug for signs of wear, carbon buildup, or damage. 

Clean the spark plug with a wire brush or replace it if necessary. Ensure the spark plug gap is set to the manufacturer’s specifications.  Regularly checking and replacing the spark plug is a simple maintenance task that can improve engine performance and fuel efficiency.

## 6. Governor Issues: Speed Regulation Problems

The governor regulates the engine speed, maintaining a consistent RPM under varying loads. If the governor is malfunctioning, it can cause the engine to surge or fluctuate in speed. The governor linkage may be sticking or binding, preventing it from properly controlling the throttle. 

Inspect the governor linkage for any signs of damage or corrosion. Lubricate the linkage with a light oil to ensure smooth operation. If the governor is severely damaged, it may need to be replaced.

## 7. Keeping Your Honda Mower Clean: Preventative Maintenance

Regular cleaning of your entire lawn mower is crucial for preventing many issues, including the revving up and down problem.  Dirt and debris can accumulate around the engine, carburetor, and other components, contributing to performance problems.  After each use, remove grass clippings and debris from the mower deck and engine.

## FAQ: Honda Lawn Mower Revving Up and Down

**Q: How often should I replace my Honda lawn mower’s air filter?**
A:  Generally, you should replace the air filter every 25-50 hours of use, or at least once a year. If you mow in dusty conditions, you may need to replace it more frequently. A clean air filter ensures proper airflow and optimal engine performance.

**Q: Can I use fuel stabilizer in my Honda lawn mower?**
A: Yes, absolutely! Fuel stabilizer prevents gasoline from degrading and forming gum and varnish, especially during storage. Adding fuel stabilizer to your gas can significantly extend its shelf life and prevent fuel system problems.

**Q: What if I’ve cleaned the carburetor and the problem persists?**
A: If cleaning the carburetor doesn’t resolve the issue, there may be a more serious problem, such as a faulty governor or a vacuum leak. It’s best to consult a qualified lawn mower mechanic for further diagnosis and repair.

**Q: Is it safe to use carburetor cleaner spray?**
A: Yes, carburetor cleaner spray is generally safe to use when following the manufacturer’s instructions. However, always use it in a well-ventilated area and avoid spraying it on hot engine components.
