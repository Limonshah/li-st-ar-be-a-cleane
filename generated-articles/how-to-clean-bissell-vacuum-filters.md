## Keeping Your Bissell Running Smoothly: How To Clean Bissell Vacuum Filters

Is your Bissell vacuum losing suction? A clogged filter is often the culprit! Cleaning your Bissell vacuum filters regularly is crucial for maintaining its performance and ensuring a truly clean home. This article will guide you through the process, step-by-step, so you can breathe easier knowing your vacuum is working its best. We’ll cover different filter types, cleaning methods, and how often you should tackle this important maintenance task. 

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly cleaning your Bissell vacuum filters improves suction power.
*   Different filter types require different cleaning methods.
*   Consistent maintenance extends the life of your vacuum.

**Quick Answer:** Cleaning Bissell vacuum filters typically involves removing them, rinsing with cool water (for washable filters), allowing them to dry *completely* before reinstalling, and replacing them when they become damaged or no longer effective.

## Why Cleaning Your Bissell Filters Matters

Your Bissell vacuum filter is the first line of defense against dust, dirt, and allergens. Over time, these particles build up, restricting airflow and reducing suction. This means your vacuum has to work harder, potentially shortening its lifespan. A dirty filter can also release trapped particles back into the air, defeating the purpose of vacuuming! Maintaining a clean filter ensures efficient cleaning and a healthier indoor environment. If you're noticing reduced suction, it's time to check your filter. 

## Identifying Your Bissell Vacuum Filter Type

Bissell vacuums use various filter types, and knowing which one you have is the first step to cleaning it correctly. Common types include:

*   **Foam Filters:** These are often pre-filters, designed to catch larger debris. They are typically washable.
*   **Felt Filters:** Commonly found in older models, these are usually disposable and need replacing.
*   **HEPA Filters:** High-Efficiency Particulate Air filters trap very small particles, making them ideal for allergy sufferers. Some HEPA filters are washable, while others are not.
*   **Carbon Filters:** These filters help to neutralize odors. They are generally not washable and require replacement.

Always consult your Bissell vacuum’s owner’s manual to identify the specific filter types used in your model. This will ensure you use the correct cleaning method.

## How to Clean Washable Bissell Filters

Many Bissell filters are designed to be washable, making maintenance simple. Here’s how to do it:

1.  **Locate and Remove:** Turn off and unplug your vacuum. Locate the filter compartment (refer to your manual) and remove the filter.
2.  **Rinse with Cool Water:** Rinse the filter under cool running water. Avoid using soap or detergents, as these can damage the filter material. Gently massage the filter to loosen dirt and debris.
3.  **Dry Completely:** This is *crucial*. Allow the filter to air dry for at least 24-48 hours, or until completely dry. Do *not* reinstall a damp filter, as this can damage your vacuum motor.
4.  **Reinstall:** Once completely dry, reinstall the filter into its compartment.

## Replacing Non-Washable Bissell Filters

Some Bissell filters, like carbon filters and certain HEPA filters, are not washable and must be replaced when dirty. 

1.  **Identify Replacement Filter:** Check your owner’s manual or the Bissell website to determine the correct replacement filter for your model.
2.  **Remove Old Filter:** Turn off and unplug your vacuum. Locate the filter compartment and remove the old filter.
3.  **Install New Filter:** Insert the new filter into the compartment, ensuring it’s properly seated.

Regular filter replacement is essential for maintaining optimal performance. If you're struggling with odors, a new carbon filter might be the solution.

## How Often Should You Clean or Replace Your Filters?

The frequency of filter cleaning or replacement depends on several factors, including how often you vacuum, the type of flooring you have, and whether you have pets. 

*   **Washable Filters:** Clean washable filters every 1-3 months, or more often if you vacuum frequently or have pets.
*   **Non-Washable Filters:** Replace non-washable filters every 3-6 months, or as recommended in your owner’s manual.
*   **HEPA Filters:** Replace HEPA filters every 6-12 months, or when you notice a decrease in suction or an increase in allergens.

Regular maintenance will help extend the life of your filters and keep your vacuum performing optimally. If you notice your vacuum is still struggling with suction after cleaning the filters, you might also want to check for clogs in the hose or brush roll.
