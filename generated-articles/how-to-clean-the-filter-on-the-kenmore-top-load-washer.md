## Keeping Your Kenmore Washer Fresh: How To Clean The Filter

Is your Kenmore top load washer leaving clothes dirtier than before, or draining slower than usual? A clogged filter is often the culprit. Cleaning the filter on your Kenmore top load washer is a simple maintenance task that can significantly improve its performance and extend its lifespan. This guide will walk you through the process step-by-step, ensuring your laundry stays clean and your washer runs smoothly. We’ll cover everything from locating the filter to cleaning it and getting it back in place.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly cleaning your Kenmore top load washer filter (every 6 months) prevents clogs.
*   A clean filter improves washing performance and drainage.
*   This simple task can extend the life of your washing machine.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean the filter on a Kenmore top load washer, locate the access panel (usually near the bottom front), drain any remaining water, remove the filter, clean away lint and debris, and reinstall it securely. This process typically takes less than 30 minutes.

## Why Cleaning Your Kenmore Washer Filter Matters

Think of your Kenmore top load washer’s filter as its first line of defense against unwanted debris. It catches lint, hair, coins, and other small objects that could damage the pump or clog the drain lines. Over time, this buildup restricts water flow, leading to longer wash cycles, reduced cleaning effectiveness, and even potential damage to your appliance. Regularly cleaning this filter is a proactive step towards maintaining a healthy and efficient washing machine. Ignoring it can lead to more serious (and costly) repairs down the road.

## Locating the Filter on Your Kenmore Top Load Washer

The location of the filter can vary slightly depending on your specific Kenmore top load washer model. However, it’s generally found behind an access panel on the front of the machine, near the bottom.  You’ll likely see a small door or panel that you can pry open with a flathead screwdriver or your fingers.  Consult your Kenmore washer’s user manual if you’re having trouble locating it.  Knowing where the filter is located is the first step to keeping your Kenmore running optimally. If you're unsure about your model, you can find helpful resources online or contact Kenmore customer support.

## Preparing to Remove the Filter: Safety First!

Before you start removing the filter, safety is paramount. First, unplug your Kenmore top load washer from the power outlet to prevent any electrical hazards. Next, you’ll need to drain any remaining water from the washer. Many models have a small drain hose located near the filter access panel. Place a shallow pan or towels underneath the hose to catch the water.  Be prepared for some water to spill, even if you drain it carefully.  Once the water is drained, you’re ready to proceed with filter removal.

## Removing and Cleaning the Filter: A Step-by-Step Guide

Now for the main event! Once the water is drained and the washer is unplugged, carefully remove the filter. It might twist out or simply pull straight out, depending on the model.  Inspect the filter closely. You’ll likely find a collection of lint, hair, coins, buttons, and other debris. Use a soft brush, an old toothbrush, or your fingers (wearing gloves is recommended) to remove all the accumulated gunk. Rinse the filter thoroughly under running water until it’s completely clean.  If the filter is particularly dirty, you can soak it in warm, soapy water for a few minutes before scrubbing.  Don't use harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these could damage the filter.

## Reinstalling the Filter and Testing for Leaks

After cleaning, carefully reinstall the filter, ensuring it’s securely in place.  Twist it back in if that’s how it came out, or simply push it firmly into its slot.  Close the access panel.  Now, plug your Kenmore top load washer back into the power outlet. Run a short wash cycle (with no clothes) to test for leaks around the filter access panel. If you notice any leaks, unplug the washer immediately and double-check that the filter is properly installed and sealed.  Addressing leaks promptly will prevent water damage.

## Maintaining Your Filter: Prevention is Key

Cleaning the filter is important, but preventing clogs is even better.  Here are a few tips to help keep your Kenmore top load washer filter clean:

*   **Empty pockets:** Always check pockets before loading clothes into the washer.
*   **Use laundry bags:**  Use mesh laundry bags for delicate items like socks and lingerie to prevent small pieces from escaping.
*   **Avoid overloading:** Overloading the washer can strain the filter and increase the amount of lint produced.
*   **Regular cleaning schedule:** Aim to clean the filter at least every six months, or more frequently if you wash a lot of heavily soiled items.
*   **Consider a water softener:** Hard water can contribute to mineral buildup, which can clog the filter.
