## Keeping Your Style Flowing: How To Clean Your Dyson Airwrap Filter

Is your Dyson Airwrap not performing like it used to? Reduced airflow can lead to longer styling times and less impressive results. Often, the culprit is a clogged filter. Cleaning the filter on your Dyson Airwrap is a simple process that can significantly improve its performance and extend its lifespan. This article will guide you through each step, ensuring your Airwrap continues to deliver salon-quality results. We’ll cover everything from locating the filter to cleaning it effectively and safely.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly cleaning your Dyson Airwrap filter maintains optimal airflow.
*   A clean filter prevents overheating and extends the life of your device.
*   The cleaning process is quick, easy, and requires minimal effort.

**Quick Answer:** To clean the Dyson Airwrap filter, locate it at the base of the handle, twist to remove, and gently brush away dust and debris with a soft brush. Avoid using water or detergents. Reinstall the filter once clean, ensuring it clicks back into place.

## Why Cleaning Your Dyson Airwrap Filter Matters

Your Dyson Airwrap uses a filter to capture dust, hair, and other particles, preventing them from entering the motor. Over time, this filter becomes clogged, restricting airflow. Reduced airflow means your hair takes longer to dry and style, and the Airwrap has to work harder. This extra strain can lead to overheating and potentially damage the motor. Regularly cleaning the filter ensures efficient operation and prevents costly repairs. It’s a small task that makes a big difference in the longevity and performance of your beloved styling tool.

## Locating the Dyson Airwrap Filter

Finding the filter is the first step in the cleaning process. The filter is located at the base of the Dyson Airwrap handle, where it connects to the main body. Look for a circular section with small ridges or grooves. To access the filter, you’ll need to twist the base of the handle. Most models require a counter-clockwise twist, but check your user manual if you’re unsure. Once twisted, the filter section should easily detach, revealing the filter itself.

## The Best Way to Clean Your Airwrap Filter: A Step-by-Step Guide

Now that you’ve located and removed the filter, it’s time to clean it. Here’s a simple, effective method:

1.  **Gather Your Supplies:** You’ll need a soft brush, such as a paintbrush or a clean toothbrush. Avoid using abrasive brushes, as these can damage the filter.
2.  **Brush Away Debris:** Gently brush the filter in a circular motion to remove dust, hair, and other particles. Pay attention to the grooves and crevices where debris tends to accumulate.
3.  **Inspect for Stubborn Particles:** If some particles are stuck, use the brush to carefully dislodge them. Avoid applying excessive force.
4.  **Avoid Water and Detergents:** *Never* wash the filter with water or use detergents. These can damage the filter material and compromise its effectiveness.
5.  **Reinstall the Filter:** Once clean, carefully reinstall the filter into the base of the handle. Twist clockwise until it clicks securely into place.

## How Often Should You Clean the Dyson Airwrap Filter?

The frequency of filter cleaning depends on how often you use your Dyson Airwrap and the environment you use it in. As a general guideline, you should aim to clean the filter at least once a month. If you use your Airwrap daily or live in a dusty environment, you may need to clean it more frequently – perhaps every week or two. Regularly checking the filter for visible debris is a good habit to develop. A clogged filter will noticeably reduce airflow, signaling it’s time for a cleaning.

## Troubleshooting: What If Cleaning Doesn’t Improve Airflow?

If you’ve cleaned the filter and are still experiencing reduced airflow, there are a few other things you can check. First, ensure the filter is properly installed and securely clicked into place. Next, inspect the Airwrap attachments for any blockages. Hair can sometimes accumulate inside the attachments, restricting airflow. You can clean the attachments with a dry cloth or a soft brush. If the problem persists, there may be an issue with the motor or internal components. In this case, it’s best to contact Dyson customer support for assistance. Don't forget to also clean your [Dyson Airwrap attachments](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-dyson-airwrap-attachments) regularly.

## Beyond the Filter: Complete Dyson Airwrap Care

Cleaning the filter is just one aspect of maintaining your Dyson Airwrap. To keep your styling tool in top condition, consider these additional tips:

*   **Wipe Down the Exterior:** Regularly wipe down the exterior of the Airwrap with a soft, dry cloth to remove dust and product buildup.
*   **Clean the Attachments:** Clean the attachments after each use to prevent hair and product from accumulating.
*   **Store Properly:** Store your Airwrap in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures.
*   **Check the Cord:** Inspect the power cord for any signs of damage.

Taking these steps will help ensure your Dyson Airwrap continues to deliver exceptional styling results for years to come.
