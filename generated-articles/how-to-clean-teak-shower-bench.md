## Keeping Your Teak Shower Bench Beautiful: A Cleaning Guide

Is your teak shower bench looking a little worse for wear? Don't worry, it's a common problem! Teak is a beautiful and durable wood, but it *does* require some care to maintain its rich color and smooth finish, especially in the humid environment of a shower. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about how to clean a teak shower bench, keeping it looking fantastic for years to come. We’ll cover everything from daily maintenance to tackling stubborn mildew.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly wipe down your bench after each use.
*   Use mild soap and water for routine cleaning.
*   Address mildew promptly with a teak cleaner.
*   Oil your bench periodically to prevent drying and cracking.

**Quick Answer:** To clean a teak shower bench, wipe it down with a soft cloth and warm, soapy water after each use. For deeper cleaning, use a teak cleaner to remove mildew and soap scum, then re-oil the wood to protect it.

## Why Teak Needs Special Cleaning Attention

Teak wood is naturally oily, which is why it’s so resistant to water damage. However, that natural oil can also attract soap scum and mildew, especially in a warm, moist shower environment. Unlike other woods, harsh chemicals can actually *damage* teak, stripping away its protective oils. That’s why it’s important to use gentle cleaning methods specifically designed for teak.  Proper cleaning not only keeps your bench looking good but also extends its lifespan.  Ignoring cleaning can lead to a dull, gray appearance and potential cracking.

## Daily & Weekly Maintenance for a Sparkling Bench

Consistent, light cleaning is the best way to prevent buildup and keep your teak shower bench looking its best. After each shower, give the bench a quick wipe down with a soft cloth. This removes excess water and prevents soap scum from settling.  For weekly cleaning, a simple solution of warm water and a mild dish soap works wonders.  Avoid abrasive cleaners, as they can scratch the wood. 

*   Use a microfiber cloth to avoid leaving streaks.
*   Rinse thoroughly with clean water after washing.
*   Dry the bench completely to prevent mildew growth.

## Tackling Mildew on Your Teak Bench

Mildew is a common issue with teak shower benches, appearing as dark spots or a fuzzy growth. Don't panic! Mildew can be removed, but it requires a specific approach. Avoid bleach-based cleaners, as they can damage the wood. Instead, opt for a dedicated teak cleaner specifically formulated to remove mildew without harming the wood’s natural oils.  Follow the product instructions carefully. 

*   Apply the teak cleaner to the affected areas.
*   Let it sit for the recommended time (usually a few minutes).
*   Gently scrub with a soft-bristled brush.
*   Rinse thoroughly with clean water.

For particularly stubborn mildew, you might need to repeat the process. If you're dealing with a significant mildew problem throughout your shower, our article on [how to clean mold in the shower](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-in-shower) can provide additional guidance.

## Restoring and Protecting with Teak Oil

After cleaning, especially after using a teak cleaner, it’s crucial to restore the wood’s natural oils. Teak oil penetrates the wood, replenishing its protective barrier and preventing it from drying out and cracking.  Apply teak oil with a clean cloth, following the grain of the wood. Allow the oil to soak in for several hours, or even overnight, before wiping off any excess. 

*   Choose a high-quality teak oil specifically designed for outdoor or marine use.
*   Apply a thin, even coat of oil.
*   Re-oil your bench every 3-6 months, or as needed, to maintain its protection.

## Deep Cleaning: Removing Stubborn Soap Scum

Even with regular cleaning, soap scum can build up over time. For a deep clean, create a solution of warm water and a small amount of mild dish soap.  Dip a soft cloth into the solution and gently scrub the bench, paying attention to areas with heavy buildup.  You can also use a soft-bristled brush for textured areas. 

*   Avoid using abrasive sponges or scouring pads.
*   Rinse thoroughly with clean water.
*   Dry the bench completely.
*   Follow up with a coat of teak oil to restore the wood’s protection.
