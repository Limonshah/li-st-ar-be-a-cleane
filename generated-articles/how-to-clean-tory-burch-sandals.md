*   Condition leather sandals to prevent cracking and maintain suppleness.
*   Protect your sandals with a protective spray after cleaning.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean Tory Burch sandals, gently remove loose dirt with a soft brush, then wipe with a damp cloth and mild soap. For leather, condition after cleaning. Avoid harsh chemicals and direct sunlight during drying.

## Understanding Your Tory Burch Sandal Material

Before you start cleaning, it’s crucial to identify the material of your Tory Burch sandals. Different materials require different cleaning approaches. Using the wrong method can cause damage, so knowing what you’re working with is key. Tory Burch sandals come in a variety of materials, including leather, rubber, woven fabrics, and synthetic options. 

*   **Leather:** This is a common material, requiring gentle cleaning and conditioning.
*   **Rubber:** Typically found in the soles, rubber is durable and easy to clean.
*   **Woven Fabrics:** These require more delicate handling to avoid unraveling.
*   **Synthetic Materials:** Often easier to clean than natural materials, but still require care.

Knowing your sandal’s material will guide you in choosing the right cleaning products and techniques. If you're unsure, check the product label or the Tory Burch website for material information.

## Cleaning Leather Tory Burch Sandals

Leather Tory Burch sandals require a bit more attention to detail. Leather can dry out and crack if not properly cared for, so regular cleaning and conditioning are essential. Start by removing any loose dirt or debris with a soft brush, like an old toothbrush. Then, prepare a solution of lukewarm water and a mild soap, such as saddle soap or a gentle dish soap.

*   Dip a soft cloth into the soapy water and gently wipe down the leather surfaces.
*   Avoid soaking the leather, as this can cause it to warp or stain.
*   Once clean, wipe away any soap residue with a clean, damp cloth.
*   Allow the sandals to air dry away from direct sunlight or heat.
*   Finally, apply a leather conditioner to restore moisture and prevent cracking. You can find excellent leather conditioners at most shoe stores. For more information on leather care, check out this guide on [how to clean leather sandals](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-leather-sandals).

## Cleaning Rubber and Synthetic Tory Burch Sandals

Cleaning rubber and synthetic Tory Burch sandals is generally simpler than cleaning leather. These materials are more durable and less prone to damage from water or mild cleaning agents. Begin by rinsing the sandals with lukewarm water to remove any loose dirt. 

*   Create a solution of lukewarm water and mild soap.
*   Use a soft brush or cloth to scrub the sandals, paying attention to any areas with visible dirt or stains.
*   Rinse thoroughly with clean water to remove all soap residue.
*   Allow the sandals to air dry completely. 
*   For stubborn stains, you can use a magic eraser, but test it in an inconspicuous area first. If you have rubber sandals, you might also find this article on [how to clean Gucci rubber sandals](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-gucci-rubber-sandals) helpful.

## Addressing Dirty Footbeds

The footbed of your Tory Burch sandals can accumulate dirt, sweat, and bacteria, leading to unpleasant odors. Cleaning the footbed regularly is crucial for hygiene and comfort. For leather footbeds, use a leather cleaner and conditioner, following the instructions above. 

*   For synthetic or rubber footbeds, you can use a solution of warm water and mild soap.
*   Use a soft brush to scrub the footbed, paying attention to any crevices.
*   Rinse thoroughly with clean water and allow to air dry completely.
*   To eliminate odors, you can sprinkle baking soda on the footbed and let it sit overnight before vacuuming it up. You can also find more information on cleaning sandal footbeds at [how to clean the footbed of sandals](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-the-footbed-of-sandals).

## Protecting Your Clean Tory Burch Sandals

Once your Tory Burch sandals are clean, it’s important to protect them from future damage. Applying a protective spray can help repel water, dirt, and stains. Choose a spray specifically designed for the material of your sandals. 

*   For leather sandals, use a leather protector spray.
*   For synthetic materials, use a fabric protector spray.
*   Apply the spray evenly, following the instructions on the product label.
*   Allow the spray to dry completely before wearing your sandals.
*   Regularly reapply the spray to maintain protection. Don't forget to also consider cleaning the soles of your sandals to keep them looking their best. You can find tips on [how to clean the bottom of sandals](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-the-bottom-of-sandals).

For oil-based stains, try applying a small amount of cornstarch to the stain and letting it sit for several hours before brushing it off. For scuff marks on leather, you can use a leather repair kit or take your sandals to a professional shoe repair shop. Remember to always test any cleaning solution in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t damage the material.
