## Why Clean Your Polywood Adirondack Chairs?

Cleaning your Polywood Adirondack chairs isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about preserving the material’s integrity. Over time, dirt, mildew, and even sunscreen can build up on the surface, potentially causing discoloration or fading. Regular cleaning prevents this buildup, ensuring your chairs maintain their vibrant color and structural strength. Plus, clean furniture is simply more enjoyable to relax in! You’ll appreciate the fresh, inviting look of well-maintained outdoor seating.

## The Simplest Method: Routine Washing

For everyday dirt and grime, a simple wash is all you need. This routine cleaning should be done every few weeks, or more often if your chairs are heavily used. Start by mixing a small amount of mild dish soap with warm water. Then, using a soft cloth or sponge, gently scrub the entire surface of the chair. Rinse thoroughly with clean water and allow to air dry. This quick process will keep your Polywood looking its best.

## Tackling Tougher Stains on Polywood

Sometimes, a simple wash isn’t enough. Stubborn stains like bird droppings, tree sap, or spilled drinks require a bit more attention. For these situations, consider using a dedicated Polywood cleaner. These cleaners are specifically formulated to remove stains without damaging the material. Apply the cleaner according to the manufacturer’s instructions, typically spraying it on, letting it sit for a few minutes, and then scrubbing with a soft brush. Rinse well and dry. If you don't have a Polywood cleaner, a solution of diluted white vinegar and water can also be effective.

### Dealing with Mildew

Mildew can sometimes appear on outdoor furniture, especially in humid climates. To remove mildew, mix a solution of one part bleach with four parts water. Apply the solution to the affected areas, let it sit for 10-15 minutes, and then scrub with a soft brush. Rinse thoroughly with clean water and dry completely. *Always* test this solution in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t cause discoloration.

## Deep Cleaning Your Polywood Chairs

For a more thorough clean, especially at the beginning or end of the outdoor season, consider a deep cleaning process. This involves a more intensive scrub and a focus on hard-to-reach areas. Begin by washing the chairs with the mild soap and water solution described earlier. Then, use a soft-bristled brush to scrub crevices and any textured areas. A toothbrush can be helpful for getting into tight spots. Rinse thoroughly and allow to dry. You might also consider using a pressure washer on a low setting, but be careful not to damage the surface.

## Protecting Your Polywood from the Elements

Prevention is key to keeping your Polywood Adirondack chairs clean and looking their best. Consider covering your chairs when they’re not in use, especially during harsh weather conditions. This will protect them from rain, snow, and excessive sun exposure. You can also apply a UV protectant spray to help prevent fading. Regularly sweeping or brushing off loose debris will also minimize the need for more intensive cleaning.

## What *Not* To Do When Cleaning Polywood

While Polywood is durable, it’s important to avoid certain cleaning methods that could cause damage. Never use abrasive cleaners, scouring pads, or steel wool, as these can scratch the surface. Avoid harsh chemicals like ammonia or solvents, as they can discolor or weaken the material. Also, avoid using a pressure washer on a high setting, as this could potentially damage the chair’s structure. Remember, gentle cleaning is always the best approach.
