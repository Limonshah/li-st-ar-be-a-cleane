## Keeping Your Lifeproof Case Clean: A Simple Guide

Is your Lifeproof case looking a little worse for wear? Don't worry, it happens! These cases are designed for adventure, and that means they’re bound to pick up dirt, grime, and maybe even a few scuffs along the way. A clean Lifeproof case not only looks better but also maintains its protective qualities. This article will show you exactly how to clean your Lifeproof case, keeping it looking and functioning like new. We’ll cover everything from quick daily wipes to deeper cleaning methods for stubborn grime.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly wipe down your case with a soft, damp cloth.
*   Use mild soap and water for more thorough cleaning.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive cleaners.
*   Pay attention to ports and crevices for trapped debris.

A Lifeproof case is an investment in protecting your phone, and proper cleaning is essential to maintaining that protection. Let's dive into the best ways to keep your case in top condition.

### Why Cleaning Your Lifeproof Case Matters

Cleaning your Lifeproof case isn’t just about aesthetics. A dirty case can harbor bacteria and contribute to the spread of germs. Plus, built-up grime can actually affect the case’s grip, potentially increasing the risk of drops. Regularly cleaning your case ensures it continues to provide the reliable protection you expect. It also helps prevent discoloration and keeps your case looking its best for longer.

### Daily Maintenance: Quick Wipes for a Fresh Look

The easiest way to keep your Lifeproof case clean is with daily maintenance. A quick wipe-down can prevent dirt and grime from building up. Simply use a soft, lint-free cloth dampened with water. Gently wipe down all surfaces of the case, paying attention to areas that come into contact with your hands. For a little extra cleaning power, you can add a tiny drop of mild dish soap to the water. Remember to always wring out the cloth well so it’s not dripping wet.

### Deep Cleaning Your Lifeproof Case: Step-by-Step

Sometimes, a simple wipe-down isn’t enough. For a more thorough clean, follow these steps. First, remove the case from your phone. This prevents any water from getting into the phone’s ports. Next, fill a sink or bowl with lukewarm water and add a small amount of mild dish soap. Submerge the case and gently scrub all surfaces with a soft-bristled brush, like an old toothbrush. This is especially helpful for getting into the small crevices around buttons and ports. Rinse the case thoroughly with clean water and allow it to air dry completely before putting it back on your phone.

### Dealing with Stubborn Grime and Stains

Got some stubborn grime or stains on your Lifeproof case? Don't reach for harsh chemicals! These can damage the case’s material and void any warranty. Instead, try a paste made from baking soda and water. Apply the paste to the stained area and gently scrub with a soft cloth. Let it sit for a few minutes, then rinse thoroughly with water. For particularly tough stains, you can try a magic eraser, but test it in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t damage the finish.

### Cleaning Different Lifeproof Case Materials

Lifeproof cases come in a variety of materials, and each requires slightly different care. 

*   **Polycarbonate:** This is the most common material and is relatively easy to clean with soap and water.
*   **TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane):** TPU is more prone to attracting dust and oils. Regular wiping with a damp cloth is essential.
*   **Rubber:** Rubber cases can be cleaned with soap and water, but avoid using abrasive cleaners that can damage the rubber.
*   **Metal:** Metal accents can be polished with a soft cloth to restore their shine.

Always check the Lifeproof website or your case’s documentation for specific cleaning recommendations.

### Avoiding Damage: What *Not* To Do

Protecting your Lifeproof case means knowing what *not* to do. Avoid using harsh chemicals like bleach, ammonia, or acetone. These can discolor or damage the case’s material. Don’t use abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as they can scratch the surface. Also, avoid putting your Lifeproof case in the dishwasher or washing machine. The high heat and harsh detergents can cause irreversible damage. Finally, never use compressed air to clean the ports, as this can force debris further inside.

*   **How often should I deep clean my Lifeproof case?** Deep clean your case every 1-2 months, or more often if you use your phone in particularly dirty environments.

*   **How do I clean the inside of my Lifeproof case?** Use a cotton swab dipped in isopropyl alcohol (use sparingly!) to gently clean the inside of the case.
*   **My Lifeproof case has a yellow tint. Can I fix it?** Yellowing is common with TPU cases. While there are DIY methods online, they may not be effective and could potentially damage the case.
