## Keeping Your Simplehuman Trash Can Sparkling Clean

Is your Simplehuman trash can starting to smell a little…off? Don't worry, you're not alone! These sleek, modern trash cans are a fantastic addition to any kitchen, but they *do* require regular cleaning to stay fresh and hygienic. A dirty trash can can quickly become a breeding ground for bacteria and unpleasant odors. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about how to clean a Simplehuman trash can, from quick daily maintenance to a thorough deep clean. We’ll cover different models and materials, ensuring your can looks and smells its best.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly wipe down the exterior.
*   Use trash bags and replace them frequently.
*   Disinfect the interior monthly.
*   Address odors with baking soda or vinegar.
*   Clean the lid and foot pedal often.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean a Simplehuman trash can, wipe down the exterior with a damp cloth and mild soap. Regularly replace the trash bag. For a deeper clean, disinfect the interior with a bleach solution (1 part bleach to 10 parts water) or a commercial disinfectant, and deodorize with baking soda.



## Understanding Your Simplehuman Trash Can

Simplehuman trash cans come in a variety of styles and materials, and knowing yours is key to cleaning it effectively. Many feature stainless steel exteriors, which are beautiful but require specific cleaning methods to avoid streaks and damage. Others have plastic bodies, which are more durable but can still harbor bacteria.  Different models also have different features, like foot pedals and liners. Understanding these differences will help you choose the right cleaning products and techniques.  Before you begin, always check the manufacturer’s instructions for any specific recommendations or warnings.

## Daily & Weekly Maintenance for a Fresh Can

Consistent, small efforts make a big difference in keeping your Simplehuman trash can clean. Start by always using trash bags! This creates a barrier between your waste and the can itself, making cleaning much easier.  After emptying the trash, give the inside of the can a quick spray with a disinfectant spray.  This helps kill bacteria and neutralize odors.  Wipe down the exterior of the can with a damp cloth and mild dish soap at least once a week. Don’t forget the foot pedal – it gets touched frequently and can accumulate germs.

## Deep Cleaning Your Simplehuman Trash Can

A deep clean should be done monthly, or more often if needed. First, empty the trash can and remove the liner. Then, wash the interior with warm, soapy water. For stainless steel cans, use a stainless steel cleaner to prevent streaks.  For plastic cans, a mild all-purpose cleaner will work well.  

Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Empty and Remove Liner:** Completely empty the can and discard the liner.
2.  **Wash with Soapy Water:** Use warm water and dish soap to scrub the interior.
3.  **Disinfect:**  Mix 1 part bleach with 10 parts water, or use a commercial disinfectant. Spray the interior and let it sit for 5-10 minutes.
4.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse the can thoroughly with clean water.
5.  **Dry Completely:** Allow the can to air dry completely before replacing the liner.

## Tackling Stubborn Odors

Even with regular cleaning, odors can sometimes linger. Baking soda is your best friend here! Sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda at the bottom of the can after replacing the liner. Baking soda absorbs odors naturally and keeps the can smelling fresh.  Another effective solution is white vinegar.  Place a small bowl of white vinegar inside the can overnight to neutralize odors.  If you're dealing with particularly stubborn smells, consider using an enzymatic cleaner, which breaks down odor-causing molecules.  If you suspect maggots, it's crucial to address the issue immediately. [Here's how to clean maggots from a trash can](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-maggots-from-trash-can).

## Cleaning Different Simplehuman Can Materials

The material of your Simplehuman trash can dictates the best cleaning approach. 

*   **Stainless Steel:** Use a stainless steel cleaner and microfiber cloth to avoid streaks. Wipe *with* the grain of the steel. Avoid abrasive cleaners, which can scratch the surface.
*   **Plastic:**  A mild all-purpose cleaner and a soft sponge are ideal. Avoid harsh chemicals, which can discolor or damage the plastic.
*   **Liners & Bags:** Always use Simplehuman-compatible liners for a perfect fit. Replace liners frequently to prevent buildup and odors.

## Maintaining the Foot Pedal & Lid

Don't forget to clean the foot pedal and lid of your Simplehuman trash can! These areas are touched frequently and can harbor germs. Wipe them down daily with a disinfectant wipe. For the foot pedal, pay attention to the area where your foot makes contact.  For the lid, check for any buildup around the edges.  If your Simplehuman can has a soft-close lid, be gentle when cleaning it to avoid damaging the mechanism.
