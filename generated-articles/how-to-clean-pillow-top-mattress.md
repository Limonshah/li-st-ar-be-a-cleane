## How To Clean a Pillow Top Mattress: A Complete Guide

Is your once-fluffy pillow top mattress looking a little…lived in? Don't worry, you're not alone! Pillow top mattresses offer incredible comfort, but their plush surface can be a magnet for dust, spills, and odors. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to effectively clean your pillow top mattress and keep it fresh for years to come. We’ll cover everything from routine maintenance to tackling tough stains, ensuring a healthier and more comfortable sleep environment.

**Takeaway:**

*   Vacuum your mattress regularly to remove dust and debris.
*   Address spills immediately to prevent staining.
*   Use gentle cleaning solutions specifically designed for mattresses.
*   Ensure your mattress is completely dry before remaking the bed.

**Quick Answer:** Cleaning a pillow top mattress involves regular vacuuming, spot cleaning with a mild detergent solution, deodorizing with baking soda, and ensuring thorough drying. Avoid harsh chemicals and excessive moisture to protect the delicate top layer.

## Understanding Your Pillow Top Mattress

Before diving into cleaning, it’s important to understand what a pillow top is and how it differs from a standard mattress. A pillow top is an extra layer of cushioning sewn onto the top of a mattress. This layer is typically made of materials like fiberfill, memory foam, or latex, providing a softer, more luxurious feel. Because of this extra layer, pillow top mattresses require a slightly different cleaning approach than traditional mattresses. You need to be gentle to avoid damaging the delicate top layer. 

This extra layer can also trap more dust mites and allergens, making regular cleaning even more crucial for allergy sufferers. Consider using a [mattress protector](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mattress-protector) to add an extra layer of defense against spills and allergens.

## Routine Maintenance: Keeping Your Mattress Fresh

Consistent, simple maintenance is the key to keeping your pillow top mattress clean and extending its lifespan. This doesn’t require hours of work, just a few minutes each month. Start with vacuuming. Use the upholstery attachment on your vacuum cleaner to thoroughly vacuum the entire surface of the mattress, paying special attention to seams and crevices where dust and debris accumulate. 

Beyond vacuuming, regularly airing out your mattress can make a big difference. On a sunny day, strip your bedding and open windows to allow fresh air to circulate. This helps to remove moisture and odors. Rotating your mattress every six months can also promote even wear and tear, extending its overall life.

## Tackling Stains on a Pillow Top Mattress

Spills happen, but acting quickly is crucial when it comes to stain removal on a pillow top mattress. The longer a stain sits, the harder it will be to remove. First, blot the spill with a clean, dry cloth to absorb as much liquid as possible. Avoid rubbing, as this can spread the stain and push it deeper into the mattress fibers.

Next, create a mild cleaning solution by mixing a small amount of liquid dish soap with cool water. Dip a clean cloth into the solution, wring it out thoroughly, and gently blot the stain. Avoid saturating the mattress. For tougher stains, like blood or urine, you might need a specialized stain remover. If you're dealing with a particularly stubborn stain, consider consulting a professional mattress cleaning service.

## Deodorizing Your Pillow Top Mattress

Over time, mattresses can develop unpleasant odors. Baking soda is a natural and effective deodorizer. Sprinkle a generous layer of baking soda over the entire surface of the mattress. Let it sit for at least a few hours, or even overnight, to absorb odors. 

After the baking soda has sat, vacuum it up thoroughly using the upholstery attachment. For a more refreshing scent, you can add a few drops of essential oil, like lavender or tea tree oil, to the baking soda before sprinkling it on the mattress. Remember to test the essential oil in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn't stain.

## Deep Cleaning Your Pillow Top Mattress

While routine maintenance and spot cleaning are important, a deep clean is recommended at least twice a year. This involves a more thorough cleaning process to remove embedded dirt and allergens. You can use a steam cleaner designed for mattresses, but be careful not to over-saturate the surface. 

Alternatively, you can create a DIY cleaning solution using equal parts white vinegar and water. Lightly spray the solution onto the mattress surface and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. Then, blot the mattress with a clean, dry cloth. If you're considering using a carpet cleaner, be sure to check if it's safe for mattresses first.

## Drying Your Pillow Top Mattress Properly

This is arguably the most important step! A damp mattress is a breeding ground for mold and mildew. After cleaning, it’s crucial to ensure your pillow top mattress is completely dry before remaking the bed. 

Open windows and use fans to circulate air. You can also use a hairdryer on a cool setting to speed up the drying process, but be careful not to overheat the mattress. Avoid using direct sunlight, as this can fade the fabric. Ensure the mattress is *completely* dry to the touch before putting sheets back on.
