## Keeping the Hot Water Flowing: How to Clean a Tankless Water Heater

Is your hot water not as hot as it used to be? Or maybe you're noticing a decrease in water pressure? These could be signs that your tankless water heater needs cleaning. A tankless water heater provides on-demand hot water, making it a convenient and efficient choice for many homes. However, over time, mineral deposits – primarily calcium and magnesium – can build up inside the unit, reducing its performance and lifespan. This guide will walk you through how to clean your tankless water heater, ensuring years of reliable hot water. We’ll cover everything from identifying the need for cleaning to the flushing process itself.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning prevents scale buildup.
*   Flushing extends the life of your unit.
*   Descaling solutions can remove stubborn deposits.
*   Professional maintenance is recommended annually.

**What does it mean to clean a tankless water heater?**

Cleaning a tankless water heater involves flushing the system with a descaling solution to remove mineral buildup from the heat exchanger. This process restores efficiency and prevents potential damage, typically taking between 30 minutes to an hour depending on the level of buildup.

## Why Regular Cleaning is Crucial for Tankless Water Heaters

Tankless water heaters are fantastic, but they're susceptible to scale buildup. Hard water contains minerals like calcium and magnesium. When heated, these minerals precipitate out and form scale inside the heat exchanger. This scale acts as an insulator, forcing the unit to work harder to heat the water, reducing efficiency and potentially leading to overheating and failure. Regular cleaning, typically every 6-12 months depending on water hardness, prevents this buildup and keeps your system running smoothly. Ignoring this maintenance can lead to costly repairs or even the need for a full replacement.

## Identifying When Your Tankless Water Heater Needs Cleaning

Don't wait for a cold shower to realize your tankless water heater needs attention. Several signs indicate it's time for a cleaning. A noticeable decrease in hot water temperature is a primary indicator. You might also experience fluctuating water temperatures, where the water starts hot and then quickly cools down. Reduced water flow is another sign, as scale buildup restricts water passage. Finally, unusual noises coming from the unit, like rumbling or banging, can signal scale buildup interfering with the heating process. If you notice any of these, it’s time to take action.

## Gathering Your Supplies for Tankless Water Heater Cleaning

Before you begin, gather the necessary supplies. You'll need a descaling solution specifically designed for tankless water heaters – vinegar can be used, but dedicated solutions are often more effective. You’ll also need a bucket, a garden hose, adjustable pliers, a screwdriver, and protective eyewear.  A pump (optional, but helpful) can assist with circulating the cleaning solution.  Finally, have a towel handy for any spills.  Having everything prepared beforehand will make the process much smoother.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Flushing Your Tankless Water Heater

Now, let's get to the cleaning process. First, turn off the power to the water heater at the breaker box. Next, close the cold water inlet valve. Connect the garden hose to the drain valve on the water heater and direct the other end to a suitable drain. Open the drain valve and allow any remaining water to drain from the system. Once drained, carefully pour the descaling solution into the water heater through the cold water inlet, following the manufacturer's instructions for dilution.  

*   **Circulation:** If you have a pump, connect it to the cold water inlet and circulate the solution for the recommended time (usually 30-60 minutes). If you don't have a pump, you can repeatedly flush the solution in and out of the unit.
*   **Flushing:** After circulation, open the drain valve again and flush the system with clean water until the water runs clear.
*   **Final Steps:** Close the drain valve, open the cold water inlet valve, and turn the power back on. Test the hot water to ensure it's flowing properly and reaching the desired temperature.

## Dealing with Stubborn Scale Buildup

Sometimes, scale buildup is particularly stubborn. If flushing with a descaling solution doesn't fully resolve the issue, you may need to repeat the process. Consider using a stronger descaling solution, but always follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully. In extreme cases, you might need to disassemble parts of the water heater for a more thorough cleaning. However, this is best left to a qualified plumber.  Removing sediment is also important; learn more about [how to clean sediment from water heater](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-sediment-from-water-heater).

## Preventing Future Buildup and Maintaining Your System

Preventing scale buildup is easier than removing it. Consider installing a water softener if you have hard water. This will remove the minerals that cause scale formation. Regularly flushing your tankless water heater (every 6-12 months) is also crucial. Additionally, schedule an annual professional maintenance checkup. A plumber can inspect the unit for any potential issues and perform a more thorough cleaning if needed.  Proper maintenance will significantly extend the life of your tankless water heater.
