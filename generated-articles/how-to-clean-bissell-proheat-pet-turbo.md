## Keeping Your Carpets Clean: How to Clean a Bissell Proheat Pet Turbo

Is pet hair taking over your home? A Bissell Proheat Pet Turbo is a fantastic tool for tackling tough messes and odors, but even the best machines need regular cleaning to maintain peak performance. This article will guide you through a complete cleaning process for your Bissell Proheat Pet Turbo, ensuring it continues to deliver a spotless clean for years to come. We’ll cover everything from emptying the tanks to deep cleaning the brush roll, so you can confidently keep your carpets looking and smelling their best. Let's dive in and learn how to properly care for your carpet cleaner!

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly empty and clean both the clean and dirty water tanks.
*   Rinse the brush roll and remove any tangled hair or debris.
*   Clean the spray nozzle and hose to prevent clogs.
*   Use Bissell cleaning solutions or a diluted vinegar solution for optimal results.

**Quick Answer:** To clean your Bissell Proheat Pet Turbo, empty and rinse both tanks, clean the brush roll by removing hair and debris, flush the hose with clean water, and wipe down the exterior. Regular maintenance extends the life of your machine and ensures effective cleaning.

## 1. Emptying and Cleaning the Tanks – A Crucial First Step

Before you begin any deep cleaning, it’s essential to empty and rinse both the clean and dirty water tanks. This prevents the buildup of mold, mildew, and unpleasant odors. Start by removing both tanks from the unit. The dirty water tank will likely contain debris and dirty water, so handle it carefully to avoid spills. Empty the dirty water tank into a sink or toilet, and rinse it thoroughly with warm water. 

Next, empty the clean water tank and rinse it as well. Even if you only used clean water, residue can still accumulate.  Consider adding a small amount of mild dish soap to the rinse water for a more thorough clean.  Allow both tanks to air dry completely before reattaching them to the machine.  [https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bissell-big-green-machine](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bissell-big-green-machine) provides additional insights into tank cleaning for larger Bissell models.

## 2. Deep Cleaning the Brush Roll – Removing Pet Hair and Debris

The brush roll is the workhorse of your Bissell Proheat Pet Turbo, and it’s prone to collecting pet hair, dirt, and other debris. A clogged brush roll reduces cleaning effectiveness. To access the brush roll, you’ll typically need to remove the foot of the carpet cleaner. Consult your owner’s manual for specific instructions, as the process can vary slightly depending on the model. 

Once the brush roll is removed, use scissors or a seam ripper to carefully cut away any tangled hair or fibers. You can also use a vacuum cleaner with a hose attachment to remove loose debris.  Rinse the brush roll with warm water and allow it to dry completely before reinstalling it.  Regularly cleaning the brush roll will significantly improve your carpet cleaner’s performance.

## 3. Flushing the Hose and Spray Nozzle – Preventing Clogs

Over time, the hose and spray nozzle of your Bissell Proheat Pet Turbo can become clogged with mineral deposits or cleaning solution residue. This can reduce water flow and cleaning power. To flush the hose, detach it from the machine and run warm water through it.  

Check the spray nozzle for any blockages and use a small brush or pin to clear them. You can also soak the spray nozzle in a solution of warm water and vinegar to dissolve mineral deposits. Ensure all traces of vinegar are rinsed away before reattaching the hose and nozzle.  A clear hose and nozzle are vital for consistent cleaning performance.

## 4. Cleaning the Exterior – Maintaining a Fresh Look

The exterior of your Bissell Proheat Pet Turbo can accumulate dust and dirt over time. Wipe down the exterior surfaces with a damp cloth and a mild cleaning solution. Avoid using abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the plastic. 

Pay attention to the power switch, handle, and any other areas that are frequently touched. A clean exterior not only looks better but also helps prevent the spread of germs.  Remember to unplug the machine before cleaning the exterior.

## 5. Addressing Stubborn Odors – Vinegar to the Rescue

Pet odors can linger in your Bissell Proheat Pet Turbo, even after thorough cleaning. Vinegar is a natural and effective odor neutralizer. After cleaning the tanks and other components, fill the clean water tank with warm water and add one cup of white vinegar. 

Run the machine through a full tank of water (without carpet cleaning solution) to flush out any remaining odors.  This will help freshen up your carpet cleaner and leave your carpets smelling clean.

## 6. Filter Maintenance – Ensuring Air Quality

Your Bissell Proheat Pet Turbo likely has a filter that traps dust and allergens. A dirty filter reduces suction power and can release particles back into the air. Check your owner’s manual for the location of the filter and instructions on how to clean or replace it. 

Some filters are washable, while others need to be replaced periodically.  Regular filter maintenance is crucial for maintaining air quality and ensuring optimal cleaning performance.

## 7. Long-Term Storage – Protecting Your Investment

When you’re not using your Bissell Proheat Pet Turbo, proper storage is essential. Before storing the machine, ensure that all tanks are empty and dry.  Wrap the power cord neatly and store it in a safe place. 

Store the carpet cleaner in a cool, dry location away from direct sunlight.  Following these storage tips will help protect your investment and ensure that your Bissell Proheat Pet Turbo is ready to tackle your next cleaning challenge.
