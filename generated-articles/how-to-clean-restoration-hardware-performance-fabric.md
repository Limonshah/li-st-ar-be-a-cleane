**What is Restoration Hardware Performance Fabric?**

Restoration Hardware performance fabrics are engineered to withstand everyday life. They are typically stain-resistant, durable, and easy to maintain.

## Understanding Your RH Fabric: Identifying the Blend

Before you start cleaning, it’s important to understand what your Restoration Hardware performance fabric is made of. While many are similar, slight variations exist. Check the care tag on your furniture – it will provide specific cleaning instructions. If the tag is missing, a simple test can help. Dab a small, hidden area with a damp cloth. If the color transfers, professional cleaning is recommended. Knowing your fabric type will help you avoid damaging it during the cleaning process.

## Routine Cleaning: Dusting and Vacuuming

Regular maintenance is the best way to keep your Restoration Hardware performance fabric looking its best. Dust and debris can settle into the fibers, causing them to look dull and worn. Vacuum your furniture weekly using the upholstery attachment. This removes loose particles before they become embedded. Pay attention to crevices and seams where dust tends to accumulate. A consistent cleaning schedule will significantly extend the life of your upholstery.

## Spot Cleaning Spills: Act Fast!

Spills happen, but quick action is crucial when dealing with Restoration Hardware performance fabric. Blot the spill immediately with a clean, white cloth. Avoid rubbing, as this can spread the stain. Mix a small amount of mild dish soap with lukewarm water. Gently dab the solution onto the stain, working from the outside in. Rinse with clean water and blot dry. For tougher stains, consider a fabric cleaner specifically designed for performance fabrics. Remember, prompt attention is key to preventing permanent stains.

## Tackling Common Stains on Performance Fabrics

Different stains require different approaches. Here’s a breakdown of how to tackle some common culprits:

*   **Water-Based Stains (Coffee, Tea, Juice):** Follow the spot cleaning method described above.
*   **Oil-Based Stains (Grease, Food):** Sprinkle baking soda onto the stain to absorb the oil. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes, then vacuum. If the stain persists, use a solvent-based cleaner specifically designed for upholstery.
*   **Ink Stains:** Dab the stain with rubbing alcohol, using a clean cloth. Blot gently and repeat until the ink is removed.
*   **Pet Stains:** Use an enzymatic cleaner specifically formulated for pet stains. These cleaners break down the enzymes in the stain, eliminating odors and preventing re-soiling.

## Deep Cleaning: When to Call a Professional

While performance fabrics are durable, they benefit from occasional deep cleaning. This removes accumulated dirt, grime, and allergens that regular vacuuming can’t reach. Consider professional cleaning every 12-18 months, or more frequently if you have pets or heavy use. Professional cleaners have the equipment and expertise to safely and effectively clean your Restoration Hardware furniture. They can also address specific stains and odors that you may not be able to handle on your own.

## What to Avoid When Cleaning RH Performance Fabric

Certain cleaning methods can damage your Restoration Hardware performance fabric. Avoid using harsh chemicals, such as bleach or ammonia. These can discolor or weaken the fibers. Also, avoid abrasive cleaners, which can scratch the surface. Steam cleaning is generally not recommended, as the heat can damage the fabric. Always test any cleaning solution in a hidden area before applying it to the entire surface. Protecting your investment means avoiding potentially harmful cleaning practices.
