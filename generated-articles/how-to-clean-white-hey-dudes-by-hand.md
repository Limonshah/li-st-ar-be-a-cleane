## Keeping Your Kicks White: How To Clean White Hey Dudes By Hand

Let's face it: white shoes look fantastic, but they also attract dirt like magnets.  If you love your white Hey Dudes but they’re starting to look a little worse for wear, you’ve come to the right place.  This guide will walk you through a simple, effective method for cleaning your Hey Dudes by hand, restoring them to their original brightness. We’ll cover everything from gathering your supplies to tackling tough stains, ensuring your favorite shoes stay looking their best.  Cleaning your Hey Dudes doesn’t have to be a chore; it can be a quick and easy process!

**Takeaway:**

*   Use a mild soap and lukewarm water.
*   Gently scrub with a soft brush.
*   Rinse thoroughly and air dry.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals and machine washing.

**Quick Answer:** To clean white Hey Dudes by hand, mix mild soap with lukewarm water, gently scrub the shoes with a soft brush, rinse thoroughly, and allow them to air dry away from direct heat or sunlight.

## 1. Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies for White Hey Dudes

Before you begin, having the right tools makes the job much easier. You won’t need anything fancy, just a few common household items.  This preparation step ensures you have everything within reach and can focus on the cleaning process.  Don't worry about spending a lot of money; simple is best when it comes to caring for your Hey Dudes.

Here’s what you’ll need:

*   **Mild Soap:** Dish soap or laundry detergent works well. Avoid anything with bleach or harsh chemicals.
*   **Lukewarm Water:**  Hot water can damage the fabric.
*   **Soft-Bristled Brush:** An old toothbrush is perfect for getting into crevices.
*   **Clean Cloths:** Microfiber cloths are ideal for wiping and drying.
*   **Optional: Magic Eraser:** For stubborn scuffs.
*   **Optional: Shoe Trees or Paper Towels:** To help maintain shape while drying.

## 2. Preparing Your White Hey Dudes for Cleaning

First, remove the insoles from your Hey Dudes. This allows you to clean the inside of the shoe and the insoles separately.  Removing loose dirt is also crucial before you start scrubbing.  This prevents you from grinding the dirt further into the fabric during the cleaning process.

Here’s how to prepare:

*   **Remove Insoles:** Gently pull them out.
*   **Dry Brush:** Use a dry brush to remove loose dirt and debris from the shoes.
*   **Shake Out:**  Shake out any remaining dirt from inside the shoes.
*   **Loosen Laces:** If your Hey Dudes have laces, loosen them to allow for better cleaning access.

## 3. The Gentle Scrub: Cleaning the Upper Material

Now for the main event!  The key here is *gentle* cleaning.  Hey Dudes are made with a flexible, breathable material, and harsh scrubbing can damage them.  Focus on working in small, circular motions to lift dirt without causing abrasion.

Here’s the process:

*   **Mix Cleaning Solution:** Combine a small amount of mild soap with lukewarm water.
*   **Dip and Scrub:** Dip your soft-bristled brush into the solution and gently scrub the upper material of the shoes.
*   **Focus on Stains:** Pay extra attention to stained areas, but avoid excessive pressure.
*   **Clean the Sides:** Don’t forget to clean the sides and the tongue of the shoes.  You can find more general shoe cleaning tips at [https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-my-hey-dudes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-my-hey-dudes).

## 4. Tackling the Soles and Rubber Parts

The rubber soles of your Hey Dudes can get particularly dirty.  A Magic Eraser can be incredibly effective here, but use it cautiously as it can be abrasive.  For lighter dirt, the same soap and water solution works well.  Remember to rinse thoroughly to remove any soap residue.

Here’s how to clean the soles:

*   **Magic Eraser (Optional):** Gently rub the soles with a Magic Eraser to remove scuffs and marks.
*   **Soap and Water:** If you prefer, use the soap and water solution and a brush to scrub the soles.
*   **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse the soles completely to remove all traces of soap or cleaner.  If you're looking for a more comprehensive guide on cleaning shoes, check out [https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-dudes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-dudes).

## 5. Cleaning the Insoles and Laces Separately

Don't neglect the insoles and laces!  Insoles can harbor bacteria and odors, while laces can accumulate dirt and grime.  Cleaning these separately ensures a thorough clean.  Both can usually be hand-washed with the same soap and water solution.

Here’s how:

*   **Insoles:** Gently scrub the insoles with the soap and water solution and a cloth. Rinse thoroughly and allow to air dry.
*   **Laces:** Hand-wash the laces in the soap and water solution. Rinse well and hang to dry.

## 6. Drying Your White Hey Dudes Properly

Proper drying is crucial to prevent damage and maintain the shape of your shoes.  Avoid direct heat, as this can cause the material to shrink or warp.  Air drying is the best option.  Stuffing the shoes with paper towels or using shoe trees helps them retain their shape while they dry.

Here’s how to dry your Hey Dudes:

*   **Air Dry:** Allow the shoes to air dry in a well-ventilated area.
*   **Avoid Direct Heat:** Do not place them near a radiator, heater, or in direct sunlight.
*   **Stuff with Paper Towels:** Stuff the shoes with paper towels to absorb moisture and maintain their shape.
*   **Re-insert Insoles:** Once everything is completely dry, re-insert the insoles.

## 7. Preventing Future Dirt and Stains on Your Hey Dudes

Prevention is always better than cure!  Taking a few simple steps can help keep your white Hey Dudes cleaner for longer.  Consider using a protective spray designed for fabric shoes.  Regularly wiping down your shoes with a damp cloth can also prevent dirt from building up.

Here are some preventative measures:

*   **Protective Spray:** Apply a fabric protector spray to help repel dirt and stains.
*   **Regular Wiping:** Wipe down your shoes with a damp cloth after each wear.
*   **Avoid Harsh Surfaces:** Try to avoid walking on excessively dirty or rough surfaces.
*   **Rotate Your Shoes:**  Don't wear the same pair of Hey Dudes every day. Rotating them allows them to air out and reduces wear and tear.
