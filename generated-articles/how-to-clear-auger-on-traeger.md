## How To Clear A Jammed Traeger Auger – A Simple Guide

Is your Traeger refusing to feed pellets? A clogged auger is a common culprit, and thankfully, it’s often a fix you can tackle yourself. This guide will walk you through how to clear your Traeger auger, getting you back to enjoying delicious smoked meats in no time. We’ll cover everything from identifying the problem to preventative measures, ensuring your pellet grill runs smoothly. Let's dive in and get that auger flowing again!

**Takeaway:**

*   Identify the cause of the auger jam (moisture, bridging, foreign objects).
*   Disconnect power before attempting any repairs.
*   Use a shop vac and/or a wooden dowel to carefully remove the blockage.
*   Prevent future jams with proper pellet storage and regular cleaning.

A jammed Traeger auger prevents pellets from reaching the firepot, halting the smoking process. This is frustrating, but often easily resolved. Clearing the auger involves safely removing the obstruction, which could be anything from moisture-damaged pellets to a stray piece of debris. This article will provide a detailed, step-by-step process to get your Traeger back up and running.

## Understanding Why Your Traeger Auger Jams

Before you start taking things apart, it’s helpful to understand *why* your Traeger auger might be jammed. Several factors can contribute to this issue. Moisture is a major player, as damp pellets swell and bind together, creating a solid mass within the auger tube. Bridging, where pellets form a solid arch across the tube, also prevents flow. Finally, foreign objects like small twigs or debris can find their way into the auger system. 

Knowing the cause can help you prevent future jams. For example, if you live in a humid climate, storing your pellets in an airtight container is crucial. Regularly checking for and removing debris around your grill can also make a big difference.

## Safety First: Disconnecting Power

This is the most important step! Before you even *think* about touching the auger or any internal components of your Traeger, **disconnect the power**. Unplug the grill from the electrical outlet. This prevents accidental activation of the auger motor, which could cause injury. Safety should always be your top priority when working with any electrical appliance.  Double-check that the grill is completely powered off before proceeding.

## Tools You’ll Need to Clear the Auger

Gathering the right tools beforehand will make the process much smoother. You won’t need anything fancy, just a few common household items. Here’s what you’ll need:

*   **Shop Vacuum:** This is essential for removing loose pellets and debris.
*   **Wooden Dowel or Broom Handle:**  A long, slender object to gently dislodge the blockage. *Avoid metal tools* as they can damage the auger.
*   **Flashlight:** To illuminate the auger tube and see what you’re doing.
*   **Gloves:** To keep your hands clean.
*   **Screwdriver:** To access the auger (depending on your Traeger model).



## Step-by-Step Guide to Clearing the Traeger Auger

Now for the main event! Here’s how to clear your Traeger auger:

1.  **Access the Auger:** Locate the auger access panel on your Traeger. This is usually on the side or bottom of the grill. Remove the panel using a screwdriver.
2.  **Vacuum the Auger Tube:** Insert the hose of your shop vacuum into the auger tube. Vacuum out any loose pellets or debris. This will give you a clearer view of the blockage.
3.  **Gently Dislodge the Jam:** Carefully insert the wooden dowel into the auger tube. Gently push and twist to break up the blockage. *Do not force it!* You don’t want to damage the auger flights.
4.  **Vacuum Again:** Repeat the vacuuming process to remove the loosened debris.
5.  **Manually Rotate the Auger:**  If possible, try to manually rotate the auger using the dowel. This can help dislodge stubborn blockages.
6.  **Reassemble and Test:** Replace the auger access panel. Plug the Traeger back in and run a short burn cycle to test if the auger is functioning correctly. If it still doesn’t work, repeat the process.

## Preventing Future Auger Jams

Once you’ve cleared the jam, it’s time to think about prevention. Here are a few tips to keep your Traeger auger flowing freely:

*   **Store Pellets Properly:** Keep your pellets in a dry, airtight container. This prevents moisture absorption.
*   **Use High-Quality Pellets:**  Cheap pellets often contain more dust and debris, which can contribute to jams.
*   **Regular Cleaning:** Periodically vacuum out the auger tube, even if you haven’t experienced a jam.
*   **Check for Debris:** Regularly inspect the area around your grill for twigs, leaves, or other debris that could find their way into the auger system.
*   **Consider a Pellet Watcher:** Some Traeger models have a pellet watcher that alerts you when the hopper is low, preventing the auger from running dry and potentially jamming.

Maintaining a clean firepot is also crucial for optimal performance. You can learn more about that in our article on [how to clean the firepot Traeger](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-firepot-traeger).

## What If the Auger Still Won’t Clear?

If you’ve followed all the steps above and your Traeger auger is still jammed, it’s time to consider other possibilities. The auger motor itself might be faulty, or there could be a more significant blockage deeper within the system. In this case, it’s best to contact a qualified Traeger repair technician. Don’t attempt to disassemble the grill further if you’re not comfortable doing so.



## FAQ: Common Questions About Traeger Augers

**Q: How often should I clean my Traeger auger?**

A: It’s a good idea to check and vacuum your auger at least once a month, or more frequently if you live in a humid climate or use your Traeger often. Regular preventative maintenance can save you a lot of headaches down the road.

**Q: Can I use WD-40 to lubricate the auger?**

A: No, do not use WD-40 or other petroleum-based lubricants. These can attract dust and debris, making the problem worse.

**Q: What should I do if I suspect the auger motor is faulty?**

A: If you suspect a faulty auger motor, contact a qualified Traeger repair technician for diagnosis and repair.

**Q: My pellets are sticking together even in a sealed container. What’s happening?**

A: This likely means your pellets have already absorbed some moisture. Try drying them out in a well-ventilated area, or consider replacing them with a fresh batch.
