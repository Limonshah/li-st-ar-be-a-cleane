## Tackling Algae: How To Clean An Empty Above Pool With Algae

Is your above ground pool looking less inviting and more…green? Don't worry, an algae-filled, empty above ground pool isn’t a lost cause! This guide will walk you through a comprehensive cleaning process, restoring your pool to a sparkling, swim-ready condition. We’ll cover everything from initial assessment to preventative measures, ensuring you enjoy a clean pool all season long. Let's get started and reclaim your summer fun.

**Takeaway:**

*   Drain the pool completely.
*   Remove debris with a brush and net.
*   Apply an algae-specific cleaning solution.
*   Scrub all surfaces thoroughly.
*   Rinse and refill, balancing water chemistry.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean an empty above ground pool with algae, drain it completely, scrub all surfaces with a pool brush and algae cleaner, rinse thoroughly, and then refill, carefully balancing the water chemistry to prevent regrowth.

## 1. Safety First & Initial Pool Assessment

Before you even think about scrubbing, safety is paramount. Always disconnect the pump and filter before draining any pool.  Draining an above ground pool can put stress on the structure, so ensure the ground is level and stable. Once drained, take a good look at the extent of the algae growth. Is it a light green film, or a thick, stubborn bloom? Identifying the type and severity will help you choose the right cleaning approach. Different types of algae, like green, black, or yellow, may require slightly different treatments.

## 2. Removing Loose Debris and Initial Brushing

Now that the pool is empty, it’s time to remove the larger debris. Use a leaf net to scoop out leaves, twigs, and any other visible particles. Next, grab a sturdy pool brush – a nylon brush is generally best for vinyl liners, while a stainless steel brush can be used on more durable surfaces. Begin brushing the entire pool surface, paying close attention to areas with heavy algae concentration. Brushing loosens the algae, making it easier to remove with cleaning solutions.

## 3. Choosing the Right Algae Cleaner

Selecting the right algae cleaner is crucial for effective removal. Chlorine-based shock treatments are a common choice, but there are also non-chlorine options available. For stubborn algae, consider an algaecide specifically designed for above ground pools. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully, as concentrations and application methods vary.  Remember to wear gloves and eye protection when handling any pool chemicals.

## 4. Applying the Algae Cleaner & Deep Scrubbing

Once you’ve chosen your cleaner, it’s time to apply it. Dilute the cleaner according to the instructions and evenly distribute it across the pool surface. Let the cleaner sit for the recommended time – usually 15-30 minutes – to allow it to penetrate the algae.  Now, get back to scrubbing! Focus on areas with the most algae, using firm, consistent pressure. Pay attention to corners, seams, and any textured surfaces where algae can easily hide.  A thorough scrubbing is the key to removing the loosened algae and preventing it from returning quickly.

## 5. Rinsing and Inspecting for Remaining Algae

After scrubbing, thoroughly rinse the entire pool surface with clean water. A garden hose with a spray nozzle works well for this.  Ensure all traces of the cleaning solution are removed before refilling the pool.  As you rinse, carefully inspect the pool for any remaining algae. If you find stubborn patches, repeat the cleaning process – apply cleaner, scrub, and rinse.  Don't skip this step; even a small amount of remaining algae can quickly re-establish itself.

## 6. Refilling and Balancing Water Chemistry

With the pool clean and rinsed, it’s time to refill it with water. As you fill, consider using a filter sock or pre-filter to remove any debris that may be present in your water source. Once the pool is full, it’s essential to balance the water chemistry. Test the pH, alkalinity, calcium hardness, and chlorine levels. Adjust these levels as needed to maintain a healthy and sanitary swimming environment.  Proper water balance not only prevents algae regrowth but also protects your pool equipment.

## 7. Preventing Future Algae Growth

Cleaning an algae-infested pool is hard work, so prevention is key! Regularly test and balance your water chemistry. Run your pool filter for an adequate amount of time each day.  Shock the pool weekly, especially during hot weather.  Consider using an algaecide as a preventative measure, following the manufacturer's instructions.  Regularly brush the pool walls and floor to disrupt algae growth.  Keeping your pool clean and properly maintained will save you time, effort, and money in the long run.



## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How long does it take to clean an algae-filled above ground pool?**
A: The time varies depending on the severity of the algae growth, but generally, it takes a full day or two. This includes draining, scrubbing, rinsing, refilling, and balancing the water chemistry. Don't rush the process; thoroughness is key to preventing regrowth.

**Q: Can I use bleach to clean algae in my above ground pool?**
A: While bleach (sodium hypochlorite) can kill algae, it's not the ideal solution. It can be harsh on pool surfaces and requires careful handling.  Algae-specific pool cleaners are generally more effective and safer.

**Q: What causes algae to grow in above ground pools?**
A: Algae growth is typically caused by a combination of factors, including poor water circulation, imbalanced water chemistry, and insufficient sanitation. Warm temperatures and sunlight also contribute to algae growth.

**Q: How often should I shock my above ground pool?**
A: You should shock your above ground pool weekly, especially during periods of heavy use or hot weather. Shocking helps to kill algae and bacteria, keeping your pool water clean and clear.

**Q: Is it possible to clean an above ground pool without draining it?**
A: Yes, it is! You can often address mild algae blooms with a thorough brushing, water balancing, and a strong dose of algaecide. However, for severe algae infestations, draining is usually necessary for a complete clean.
