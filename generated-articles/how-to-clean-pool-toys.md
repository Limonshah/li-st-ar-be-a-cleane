## Keeping the Fun Afloat: How To Clean Pool Toys

Summer is synonymous with sunshine, splashing, and of course, pool toys! But all that fun comes with a hidden downside: dirty pool toys. These colorful additions to your pool quickly become breeding grounds for bacteria, algae, and grime. Cleaning your pool toys isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about maintaining a healthy and safe swimming environment for everyone. This article will guide you through the best methods for cleaning all types of pool toys, ensuring hours of worry-free fun. We’ll cover everything from inflatable floats to plastic toys, and even how to tackle stubborn mildew.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly rinse pool toys with clean water.
*   Use mild soap and water for a thorough cleaning.
*   Disinfect toys to kill bacteria and algae.
*   Dry toys completely to prevent mildew growth.

**Quick Answer:** To clean pool toys, rinse them with water, wash with mild soap, disinfect with a diluted bleach solution (1 tablespoon bleach per gallon of water), and allow them to air dry completely in the sun.

## Why Cleaning Pool Toys Matters

Did you know that pool toys can harbor harmful bacteria and algae? These microorganisms thrive in warm, wet environments, and your pool toys provide the perfect conditions.  Leaving toys uncleaned can lead to skin irritations, infections, and even illness, especially for children.  Regular cleaning removes these contaminants, protecting your family’s health. Plus, clean toys simply *look* better and last longer, making your pool experience more enjoyable.  Don't forget that a clean pool environment extends beyond just the water itself; it includes everything that goes *in* the water.

## Cleaning Inflatable Pool Toys: A Step-by-Step Guide

Inflatable toys, like rafts and floats, are popular choices, but they require specific cleaning attention. These toys often accumulate dirt, sunscreen residue, and algae on their surfaces.  Start by deflating the toy completely. This makes it easier to handle and ensures you can reach all areas. Next, mix a solution of mild dish soap and warm water. Use a soft cloth or sponge to gently scrub the entire surface of the inflatable, paying attention to any areas with visible grime.  Rinse thoroughly with clean water and allow it to air dry completely before re-inflating.  For tougher stains, consider a specialized inflatable cleaner.

## Tackling Hard Plastic Pool Toys

Hard plastic toys, such as diving rings and squirt guns, are durable but still prone to dirt and bacteria buildup. These toys are often tossed around on rough surfaces, leading to scratches where grime can hide. Begin by rinsing the toys under running water to remove loose debris. Then, create a cleaning solution using warm water and a mild detergent.  Use a scrub brush or sponge to thoroughly clean all surfaces, getting into any crevices.  For stubborn stains or mildew, you can use a diluted bleach solution (1 tablespoon bleach per gallon of water), but *always* rinse thoroughly afterward.

### Disinfecting Plastic Toys for Extra Protection

Disinfecting your plastic pool toys is a crucial step in ensuring a hygienic swimming experience. After washing, soak the toys in a diluted bleach solution for 10-15 minutes.  This will kill any remaining bacteria or algae.  Remember to rinse the toys *extremely* well with clean water to remove all traces of bleach.  Allow them to air dry completely in the sun, as sunlight has natural disinfecting properties.  

## Cleaning Foam Pool Toys: Gentle Care is Key

Foam pool toys, like noodles and kickboards, are lightweight and fun, but they require a gentler cleaning approach. Foam is porous, meaning it can absorb water and harbor bacteria deep within its structure. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the foam.  Instead, rinse the toys thoroughly with clean water to remove loose dirt.  Then, mix a solution of mild soap and water and gently squeeze the toy to work the solution through the foam.  Rinse repeatedly until all the soap is gone.  Squeeze out as much water as possible and allow the toy to air dry completely in a well-ventilated area.

## Dealing with Mildew on Pool Toys

Mildew is a common problem with pool toys, especially those that aren't dried properly. It appears as a fuzzy, discolored growth and can be harmful to your health.  For mild mildew, try scrubbing the affected area with a solution of white vinegar and water.  For more stubborn mildew, you can use a diluted bleach solution, but *always* test it on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn't damage the toy.  After cleaning, rinse thoroughly and allow the toy to dry completely in the sun.  Preventing mildew is key – always ensure toys are fully dry before storing them.

## Storage Solutions for Clean Pool Toys

Proper storage is just as important as cleaning.  Storing wet or damp toys can lead to mildew growth and damage.  After cleaning and drying, store your pool toys in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight.  Consider using a mesh bag or storage bin to keep them organized and protected.  This will also prevent them from getting dirty again before their next use.  Keeping your pool area tidy extends to the surrounding areas, so consider cleaning the [pool deck](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-pool-deck) as well.
