## Understanding Your Sway Shoe Material

Before you start cleaning, it’s important to identify the material of your Sway shoes. Different materials require different cleaning approaches. Sway shoes often feature canvas, leather, or synthetic materials, and knowing which you have will prevent damage. Incorrect cleaning methods can discolor, warp, or even ruin your shoes. Let's break down how to identify common Sway shoe materials.

*   **Use Shoe Trees:** Shoe trees help maintain the shape of your shoes and absorb moisture.
*   **Rotate Your Shoes:** Don't wear the same pair of Sway shoes every day. Rotating allows them to air out and recover.
*   **Address Small Marks Immediately:** If you notice a small scuff or stain, address it right away before it sets.
