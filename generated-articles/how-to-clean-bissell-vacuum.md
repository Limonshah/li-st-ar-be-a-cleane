## Keeping Your Bissell Running Like New: A Cleaning Guide

Is your Bissell vacuum losing suction, smelling a little funky, or just not performing as well as it used to? A clean vacuum is a happy vacuum, and a happy vacuum means a cleaner home! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to thoroughly clean your Bissell vacuum, from the brush roll to the filters. We’ll cover all the essential steps to restore its cleaning power and extend its lifespan. Let's dive in and get your Bissell back in top shape.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly empty the dirt tank.
*   Clean or replace filters as needed.
*   Remove and clean the brush roll.
*   Check and clear any blockages in the hose.
*   Wipe down the exterior of the vacuum.

**Quick Answer:** To clean a Bissell vacuum, empty the dirt tank, wash or replace filters, remove and clean the brush roll, check for hose blockages, and wipe down the exterior. Regular cleaning maintains suction and extends the vacuum’s life.

## 1. Emptying the Dirt Tank: The First Step to a Clean Bissell

Let's start with the most frequent task: emptying the dirt tank. This is the foundation of Bissell vacuum maintenance. A full tank drastically reduces suction power, making your vacuum work harder and less effectively. Most Bissell vacuums have an easy-release dirt tank. Simply locate the release button or latch, detach the tank, and empty the contents into a trash can. 

After emptying, it’s a good idea to rinse the tank with warm water. Ensure it’s *completely* dry before reinserting it into the vacuum. This prevents mold and mildew growth. For a deeper clean, especially if you notice odors, you can add a small amount of mild dish soap to the water. If you have a [Bissell Little Green](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bissell-little-green), you'll want to pay special attention to the tank cleaning process as it handles both clean and dirty water.

## 2. Cleaning or Replacing the Filters: Breathe Easy

Filters are crucial for trapping dust and allergens, but they get clogged over time. A clogged filter restricts airflow, diminishing suction and potentially damaging the motor. Bissell vacuums typically have multiple filters – a pre-motor filter and a post-motor filter. Check your owner’s manual to identify the filter types in your model.

*   **Washable Filters:** Most Bissell filters are washable. Remove the filters and rinse them under cool water until the water runs clear. Allow them to air dry *completely* (usually 24-48 hours) before reinstalling. Never put a wet filter back into the vacuum.
*   **Non-Washable Filters:** Some filters need to be replaced. Check your owner’s manual for replacement frequency. Replacing filters regularly ensures optimal performance. If you're experiencing issues with your vacuum's suction, consider checking the filter first.

## 3. Untangling and Cleaning the Brush Roll: Removing Hair and Debris

The brush roll is the workhorse of your Bissell vacuum, responsible for agitating carpets and loosening dirt. It’s also a magnet for hair, string, and other debris. Regularly cleaning the brush roll is essential for maintaining its effectiveness.

First, unplug the vacuum! Then, locate the brush roll access panel (usually on the bottom of the vacuum). Remove the brush roll and use scissors or a seam ripper to carefully cut away any tangled hair or string. A clean brush roll spins freely and effectively picks up dirt. If you have a pet, you’ll likely need to clean the brush roll more frequently.

## 4. Checking and Clearing the Hose and Attachments: Eliminating Blockages

A blocked hose or attachment can significantly reduce suction power. Inspect the hose for any visible obstructions. You can use a long, flexible object like a broom handle or a plumbing snake to dislodge any blockages. 

Detach any attachments and check them for clogs as well. Run warm water through the attachments to flush out any debris. Pay attention to the connection points between the hose and the vacuum body, as these are common areas for blockages to form. If you're dealing with a persistent blockage, consider using a vacuum specifically designed for reaching tight spaces.

## 5. Cleaning the Exterior: A Fresh Look

While not directly impacting performance, cleaning the exterior of your Bissell vacuum keeps it looking its best. Use a damp cloth with a mild cleaning solution to wipe down the body of the vacuum. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the plastic. 

Pay attention to the wheels and casters, as they can accumulate dirt and debris. Ensure they spin freely for easy maneuverability. A clean exterior also helps prevent the spread of dust and allergens around your home.

## 6. Addressing Odors: Keeping Your Vacuum Fresh

Over time, your Bissell vacuum can develop unpleasant odors. This is often caused by trapped dirt, dust, and moisture. Here are a few tips for eliminating odors:

*   **Baking Soda:** Sprinkle baking soda into the dirt tank and let it sit overnight. Vacuum it up the next day.
*   **Essential Oils:** Add a few drops of your favorite essential oil to a cotton ball and place it inside the dirt tank (avoid direct contact with filters).
*   **Vinegar Solution:** Wipe down the interior of the dirt tank with a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar.
