## Keep Your Home Spotless: How To Clean Bissell Vacuum for Peak Performance

Your Bissell vacuum works hard to keep your home clean. Over time, dirt, dust, and hair build up inside it. This buildup can reduce suction power and cause unpleasant odors. Learning how to clean Bissell vacuum models properly helps maintain their efficiency. Regular cleaning makes sure your vacuum continues to perform its best.

I often see people struggling with vacuums that lose power. A simple cleaning routine can fix many common problems. This guide will walk you through each step needed to clean your Bissell vacuum. We will cover everything from emptying the dirt tank to deep cleaning the brush roll. You will also find tips for troubleshooting and maintaining your machine for a long life. Let's make sure your Bissell keeps your floors spotless.

### Takeaway:

*   Regularly empty and wash your Bissell vacuum's dirt tank and filters.
*   Remove tangled hair and debris from the brush roll and nozzle.
*   Clear blockages from hoses and clean all attachments.
*   Air dry all wet components completely before reassembly.
*   Follow a cleaning schedule to extend your vacuum's life and maintain its power.

To clean a Bissell vacuum, disconnect it from power. Empty and wash the dirt tank and filters with water and mild soap. Remove hair from the brush roll and clear any hose clogs. Let all parts air dry completely before putting the vacuum back together. This process restores suction and removes odors.

## Why Regular Bissell Vacuum Cleaning Matters

Keeping your Bissell vacuum clean is very important. It stops dirt from building up inside the machine. A dirty vacuum cannot pick up debris well. This means your floors will not get as clean as they should.

Regular cleaning prevents reduced suction power. When filters get clogged, air cannot flow freely. This makes the motor work harder, but it delivers less cleaning power. We want our vacuums to work at their best.

Cleaning also extends the life of your Bissell vacuum. Dirt and debris can wear down internal parts. A clean machine runs more smoothly. This helps avoid costly repairs or early replacement. You save money by taking care of your vacuum.

A dirty vacuum can also spread bad smells. Pet hair and dust inside the tank and brush roll often create odors. Cleaning removes these sources of smell. This leaves your home smelling fresh and clean after you vacuum. It is a simple step that makes a big difference in your home's air quality.

## Essential Tools and Supplies for Bissell Cleaning

You need a few basic items to clean your Bissell vacuum properly. Having these tools ready makes the job easier. It also helps you perform a complete cleaning. You do not need many special items.

First, always have a pair of scissors. These are great for cutting tangled hair and threads from the brush roll. A small, stiff brush or an old toothbrush is also helpful. These can dislodge stubborn dirt and dust from tight spots. A microfibre cloth is good for wiping down surfaces.

You will also need a sink with running water. Mild dish soap is useful for washing certain parts. Make sure the soap is gentle and does not leave residue. Protective gloves can keep your hands clean during the process. I always use them to avoid direct contact with grime.

Remember to always unplug your vacuum before you start cleaning. Safety is the most important step. Gathering these simple tools beforehand saves you time. It helps ensure a thorough and safe cleaning experience.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Cleaning Your Bissell Vacuum's Dirt Tank and Filter

Cleaning the dirt tank and filter is a crucial part of maintaining your Bissell vacuum. These parts collect most of the debris. Keeping them clean ensures strong suction. It also prevents dirt from blowing back into your home's air.

### Emptying the Dirt Tank

Start by locating the dirt tank on your Bissell vacuum. Most models have a button or latch to release it. Press this button to detach the tank from the main body. Take the tank to a trash can.

Open the bottom of the tank to empty all the collected dirt and debris. Give it a few taps to loosen anything stuck inside. After emptying, rinse the tank under cool running water. Use a mild soap if the tank is very dirty. Make sure to rinse until all soap residue is gone.

### Washing the Filter

Bissell vacuums often have washable filters. Locate your filter; it is usually inside or attached to the dirt tank. Remove the filter carefully. Tap it over a trash can to shake off loose dust.

Rinse the filter under cool running water. Run water through it until the water runs clear. Do not use soap on pleated filters unless the manual says you can. Some filters, like those found in [Dyson vacuums](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dyson-vacuum-filter) or [Shark cordless vacuums](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-shark-vacuum-filter-cordless), require specific drying times. Squeeze out excess water gently.

Allow the filter and tank to air dry completely. This can take 24 to 48 hours. Never put them back wet, as this can damage the vacuum or cause mold. Once completely dry, reassemble the filter into the tank and attach the tank back to the vacuum. This simple cleaning step dramatically improves your vacuum's performance.

## Revitalizing Your Bissell: How to Clean the Brush Roll and Nozzle

The brush roll and nozzle are vital for picking up dirt. They often get tangled with hair and fibers. A dirty brush roll cannot spin correctly. This leads to poor cleaning performance.

### Removing Hair and Debris from the Brush Roll

First, unplug your Bissell vacuum from the power outlet. Tip the vacuum back or lay it down to access the brush roll. Some Bissell models have a cover or screws that need removal to access the brush roll. Consult your specific model's manual for instructions. Use your scissors to carefully cut away any hair, string, or fibers wrapped around the brush roll. Be gentle to avoid damaging the bristles.

Pull the cut hair and debris away from the brush roll. You might need your fingers or a small tool to fully clear it. Check the ends of the brush roll for any trapped debris. These areas can cause the brush to seize. Many users find this step similar to cleaning the [head of a Dyson vacuum](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dyson-vacuum-head), as both require careful debris removal.

### Cleaning the Nozzle and Brush Housing

After cleaning the brush roll, inspect the nozzle opening. This is where air and debris enter the vacuum. Use a small brush or your fingers to remove any clogs. Check the housing area around the brush roll for dirt buildup.

Wipe down these areas with a damp cloth. You can use a mild soap solution if grime is heavy. Make sure no moisture gets into electrical parts. Allow all parts to dry completely before reassembling your vacuum. A clean brush roll and nozzle ensure maximum dirt pickup and powerful suction.

## Deep Cleaning Bissell Hoses, Attachments, and External Parts

Beyond the main components, hoses and attachments also collect dirt. Cleaning these parts ensures air flows freely. It also prevents debris from spreading. Ignoring these areas can lead to clogs and bad smells.

### Clearing Hose Clogs

Hoses are common places for clogs. Pet hair, large debris, or even small toys can get stuck. First, detach the hose from both ends of your Bissell vacuum. Visually inspect the hose for any visible blockages. You can often see the obstruction.

If you cannot see it, try pushing a broom handle or a long, flexible tool through the hose. Be careful not to puncture the hose. You should feel the blockage dislodge. For stubborn clogs, some people run warm water through the hose. If you do this, make sure the hose dries completely for at least 24 hours before reattaching it. This step is important for all types of vacuums, including [Tineco models](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-tineco-vacuum) and even [Dirt Devil vacuums](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dirt-devil-vacuum).

### Cleaning Attachments

Your Bissell vacuum comes with various attachments. These include crevice tools, upholstery tools, and dusting brushes. These attachments can accumulate dirt and dust. Disconnect all attachments from the vacuum. Wash them in warm, soapy water.

Use a small brush to scrub away any grime. Rinse them thoroughly under running water. Ensure all soap residue is removed. Place the attachments on a towel to air dry completely. They must be dry before you store them or reattach them.

### Wiping Down the Exterior

The exterior of your Bissell vacuum can get dusty and dirty. Use a slightly damp microfibre cloth to wipe down the entire outer surface. Do not use harsh chemicals, as these can damage the plastic. A small amount of mild soap in the water is fine for stubborn spots. Pay attention to crevices and wheels. This makes your vacuum look clean and prevents outside dirt from entering the system. A clean exterior reflects a well-cared-for appliance.

## Troubleshooting Common Bissell Cleaning Issues

Even after cleaning, you might face some common issues with your Bissell vacuum. Understanding how to fix them saves time and frustration. Many problems relate back to incomplete cleaning or missed spots. We can solve most issues with simple steps.

### Dealing with Persistent Odors

If your Bissell vacuum still smells bad after cleaning, odors might be trapped deep inside. Pet odors are a common source. Try sprinkling a small amount of baking soda inside the empty dirt tank. Let it sit for a few hours before rinsing it out. Some specific Bissell models, like the [Bissell Little Green](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-bissell-little-green) or [Bissell Revolution Pet Pro](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-bissell-revolution-pet-pro), specialize in pet cleanup and can sometimes retain odors from pet accidents. Always ensure every part is fully dry. Any dampness can lead to mildew and bad smells. You can also try cleaning the hose thoroughly.

### Restoring Lost Suction

Lost suction is a frequent complaint. First, double-check that your dirt tank is empty and clean. Ensure the filter is completely dry and correctly placed. A wet or clogged filter severely reduces suction. Next, inspect the brush roll for any remaining hair tangles. Even a small amount of hair can stop it from spinning effectively.

Check all hoses and attachments for clogs. Use the method described earlier to clear them. Make sure all parts are sealed properly when reassembled. A small gap can cause air leaks. Air leaks weaken suction power significantly. If you have done all these things and still have low suction, it might be a belt issue or a motor problem.

### Brush Roll Not Spinning

If your brush roll does not spin, check a few things. First, make sure the vacuum is on the correct setting for your floor type. Some vacuums have a setting to turn off the brush roll. Next, examine the brush roll for hair and debris. Even a tiny piece can jam it. Cut and remove all tangled items.

Inspect the belt that connects the motor to the brush roll. If the belt is broken or stretched, the brush roll will not spin. You may need to replace the belt. Refer to your Bissell vacuum manual for specific instructions on replacing the belt. Sometimes, the brush roll motor can fail, but this is less common.

## Maintaining Your Bissell: Tips for Longevity and Performance

Beyond regular cleaning, ongoing maintenance helps your Bissell vacuum last longer. Simple habits keep your machine running at its best. This means fewer breakdowns and more efficient cleaning. I find that a little effort often saves a lot of trouble later.

Always empty the dirt tank after each use. This prevents dirt from compacting inside. It also keeps the filter from getting too dirty too quickly. A full tank reduces suction immediately. Make this a quick habit after every vacuuming session.

Check your filter regularly, perhaps every few uses. If it looks dirty, wash it. Remember to let it air dry completely before putting it back. Replacing your filter as recommended by Bissell is also important. Filters wear out over time. A new filter greatly improves air quality and suction. Many Bissell models, like the [Bissell ProHeat Pet Turbo](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-bissell-proheat-pet-turbo), rely on clean filters for optimal performance, especially when dealing with pet hair.

Inspect the brush roll often. Look for tangled hair or debris. It is easier to remove small amounts of hair regularly than to deal with a large, matted mess. Keep an eye on the drive belt. If it shows signs of wear, replace it. A worn belt can cause the brush roll to stop spinning or work inefficiently.

Store your Bissell vacuum in a dry, cool place. Avoid extreme temperatures. This helps protect plastic parts and electronic components. Do not store it in a damp garage. Proper storage contributes to its overall longevity. By following these maintenance tips, your Bissell vacuum will provide strong cleaning power for many years.
