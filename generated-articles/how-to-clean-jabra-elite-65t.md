## Why Cleaning Your Jabra Elite 65T is Important

Your Jabra Elite 65T earbuds go everywhere with you, and they’re constantly exposed to earwax, dust, and other debris. This buildup can significantly impact sound quality, potentially causing muffled audio or even blocking the speaker entirely. Regular cleaning prevents these issues and ensures your earbuds continue to perform at their best. Beyond sound quality, cleaning also promotes hygiene, removing bacteria that can accumulate in your ears.  Think of it like keeping your phone screen clean – it just feels better and works more efficiently.

## What You’ll Need to Clean Your Jabra Elite 65T

Before you start, gather the necessary supplies. You don’t need anything fancy! Keeping these items handy will make cleaning a quick and easy process. 

*   **Soft, Lint-Free Cloths:** Microfiber cloths are ideal.
*   **Cotton Swabs:** For reaching tight spaces.
*   **Isopropyl Alcohol (70% or less):** For disinfecting and removing stubborn grime. *Use sparingly!*
*   **Toothpick (Optional):** For carefully removing debris from small crevices. *Be very gentle!*
*   **Small Brush (Optional):** A soft-bristled brush, like a clean toothbrush, can help dislodge debris.

## Daily Maintenance: A Quick Wipe-Down

The easiest way to keep your Jabra Elite 65T earbuds clean is to incorporate a quick wipe-down into your daily routine. After each use, simply take a soft, dry, lint-free cloth and gently wipe the earbuds to remove any visible dirt or earwax. This prevents buildup and keeps them looking fresh.  Don't forget to wipe the outer casing and the area around the speaker mesh. This simple step can significantly extend the time between more thorough cleanings.

## Deep Cleaning Your Jabra Elite 65T Earbuds

For a more thorough cleaning, follow these steps. This should be done every few weeks, depending on how often you use your earbuds.

1.  **Power Off:** Ensure your earbuds are turned off before cleaning.
2.  **Dry Wipe:** Start by wiping the earbuds with a dry, lint-free cloth to remove loose debris.
3.  **Damp Wipe (with Alcohol):** Lightly dampen a cloth with isopropyl alcohol (70% or less). *Do not saturate the cloth!* Gently wipe the earbuds, paying attention to the speaker mesh and any areas with visible grime.
4.  **Crevice Cleaning:** Use a dry cotton swab to clean around the speaker mesh and in any other tight spaces. If necessary, *very gently* use a toothpick to dislodge stubborn debris. Be extremely careful not to damage the mesh.
5.  **Dry Thoroughly:** Allow the earbuds to air dry completely before using or charging them.
