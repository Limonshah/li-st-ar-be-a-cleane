## Keep Your Shave Smooth: How to Clean a Braun Series 7

Is your Braun Series 7 shaver not performing as well as it used to? A dirty shaver can lead to a less comfortable shave and even skin irritation. Regularly cleaning your Braun Series 7 is essential for maintaining its performance and extending its lifespan. This article will guide you through everything you need to know about cleaning your shaver, from daily quick rinses to deep cleaning with the Clean & Charge station. Let’s dive in and get your shaver back to its best!

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly rinse your shaver head under running water.
*   Use the Clean & Charge station for deep cleaning and lubrication.
*   Disassemble and manually clean the shaver components periodically.
*   Replace the cleaning solution cartridge in the Clean & Charge station as needed.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean a Braun Series 7 shaver, rinse the shaver head under warm water after each use. Periodically use the Clean & Charge station with cleaning solution for a deep clean, and manually disassemble and clean the components every few months for optimal performance.

## Why Cleaning Your Braun Series 7 Matters

Cleaning your Braun Series 7 isn’t just about hygiene; it’s about performance. Over time, hair, skin cells, and shaving cream residue build up inside the shaver head. This buildup can dull the blades, reduce the shaver’s efficiency, and even cause skin irritation. A clean shaver delivers a closer, more comfortable shave, and it also lasts longer. Think of it like maintaining any other valuable tool – regular care prevents premature wear and tear. 

## Daily Maintenance: A Quick Rinse

After each shave, the simplest and most important step is a quick rinse. Run warm water through the shaver head, ensuring you dislodge any visible hair or debris. This prevents buildup and keeps the blades functioning smoothly. Don’t use soap, as it can leave residue that interferes with the shaver’s performance.  A quick rinse takes only seconds and makes a significant difference in maintaining your shaver’s cleanliness.

## Deep Cleaning with the Clean & Charge Station

The Braun Series 7 Clean & Charge station is a game-changer for shaver maintenance. This station automatically cleans, lubricates, and charges your shaver.  It uses a special cleaning solution to remove debris and oil the blades, keeping them in top condition. 

Here’s how to use it:

1.  Fill the cleaning solution reservoir with the Braun cleaning solution.
2.  Place your shaver into the Clean & Charge station.
3.  Press the clean button to start the cleaning cycle.
4.  The station will run through a cleaning, rinsing, and drying cycle.
5.  Once complete, your shaver will be clean, lubricated, and charged.

Remember to replace the cleaning solution cartridge every 3-6 months, depending on usage. You can find replacement cartridges easily online or at most retailers that sell Braun shavers.

## Manual Cleaning: A Deeper Dive

While the Clean & Charge station is excellent, it’s also important to periodically disassemble and manually clean your Braun Series 7. This allows you to reach areas the station might miss and ensure a thorough cleaning.

Here’s how to do it:

1.  **Disassemble the shaver head:** Carefully remove the cassette and the inner foil.
2.  **Rinse the components:** Rinse all parts under warm running water.
3.  **Use a brush:** Use a small brush (like a toothbrush) to gently scrub away any stubborn debris.
4.  **Dry thoroughly:** Allow all parts to air dry completely before reassembling.
5.  **Lubricate (optional):** Apply a drop of shaver oil to the blades for extra lubrication.

This deep cleaning should be done every few months, or more frequently if you shave often.  Maintaining your tools is important, and you can also learn how to [clean a boat](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-boat) to keep other valuable items in good condition.

## Cleaning the Outer Head Screen

The outer head screen is the first line of defense against hair and debris. It can become clogged over time, reducing the shaver’s efficiency. To clean it, remove the screen and rinse it under warm water. Use a soft brush to gently scrub away any buildup. Ensure the screen is completely dry before reattaching it. A clean screen allows for optimal hair capture and a smoother shave.

## Addressing Tough Residue and Stains

Sometimes, despite regular cleaning, stubborn residue or stains can accumulate on your Braun Series 7. For these situations, you can use a mild cleaning solution. Dilute a small amount of dish soap in warm water and use a soft cloth to gently wipe the affected areas. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the shaver’s components. Always rinse thoroughly with clean water after using any cleaning solution.

## Troubleshooting Common Cleaning Issues

*   **Shaver still feels rough after cleaning:** Ensure you’ve removed all hair and debris from the blades and foil. Consider replacing the foil and cutter block if they are worn.
*   **Clean & Charge station not working:** Check the power connection and ensure the cleaning solution reservoir is filled.
*   **Shaver head difficult to remove:** Apply gentle but firm pressure while twisting the head. Avoid using excessive force.
