## Keeping Your RC Car Running: How To Clean A Brushed RC Motor

Is your RC car losing power or running erratically? A dirty brushed RC motor could be the culprit. Dust, dirt, and worn brush debris can significantly impact performance. Cleaning your motor isn’t difficult, and regular maintenance can extend its life and keep your RC adventures going strong. This article will guide you through the process of safely and effectively cleaning your brushed RC motor, ensuring it delivers the power you need. We’ll cover everything from gathering supplies to reassembling your motor, so you can get back to enjoying your hobby.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning improves motor performance.
*   Use appropriate cleaning solutions to avoid damage.
*   Proper drying is crucial to prevent corrosion.
*   Inspect brushes during cleaning for wear and tear.

**Quick Answer:** To clean a brushed RC motor, carefully disassemble it, use compressed air and isopropyl alcohol to remove dust and debris, inspect and replace brushes if needed, lubricate bearings, and reassemble.

## Why Cleaning Your Brushed RC Motor Matters

Let's face it, RC cars are built for fun, often involving off-road adventures. This means your brushed RC motor is exposed to dirt, dust, and grime. Over time, these contaminants build up inside the motor, creating resistance and reducing efficiency. A buildup of carbon dust from the brushes is particularly problematic. This dust can cause shorts and overheating, ultimately leading to motor failure. Cleaning your motor regularly prevents these issues, ensuring consistent performance and a longer lifespan for your valuable RC component. 

## Gathering Your Supplies for RC Motor Cleaning

Before you begin, having the right tools makes the job much easier. You don't need a lot, but these items are essential for a thorough cleaning. First, you’ll need a small screwdriver set to disassemble the motor. Compressed air is vital for blowing out loose debris. Isopropyl alcohol (90% or higher) is an excellent solvent for dissolving grime and carbon buildup.  You’ll also want some motor oil or bearing lubricant, and clean lint-free cloths or cotton swabs. Finally, a clean workspace is important to keep track of small parts. [Learn more about maintaining your RC car](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-brushless-motor) to keep it in top shape.

## Step-by-Step: Disassembling Your Brushed RC Motor

Disassembly is the first step in cleaning your brushed RC motor. Start by removing the motor from your RC car. Then, carefully remove the end bells, usually held in place by screws. Pay attention to how the parts fit together, or take pictures as you go for easy reassembly. Next, gently remove the armature (the rotating part with the windings). Be extremely careful not to damage the delicate commutator and brushes. Finally, remove the brushes and brush springs.  Remember, patience is key during disassembly to avoid damaging any components.

## Cleaning the Motor Components Effectively

Now that your motor is disassembled, it’s time to clean each part. Start with compressed air to blow out any loose dust and debris from the motor housing, end bells, and armature. Next, dampen a lint-free cloth or cotton swab with isopropyl alcohol and carefully clean the commutator on the armature. This removes carbon buildup and ensures good electrical contact.  Clean the inside of the motor housing and end bells with isopropyl alcohol as well.  For the brushes, you can gently clean them with a soft brush and isopropyl alcohol, but inspect them closely for wear. If the brushes are worn down significantly, it’s time to replace them.

## Lubrication and Brush Inspection: Key Maintenance Steps

After cleaning, lubrication is crucial. Apply a small drop of motor oil or bearing lubricant to the motor bearings. This ensures smooth operation and reduces friction. Rotate the armature by hand to distribute the lubricant evenly.  While you have the brushes removed, this is the perfect time to inspect them. Look for cracks, uneven wear, or if they are significantly shorter than new brushes. Worn brushes can cause sparking and reduced performance. Replacing worn brushes is a relatively inexpensive way to restore your motor’s power.  If you notice any damage to the commutator, it may require professional repair.

## Reassembling Your Brushed RC Motor

Reassembly is essentially the reverse of disassembly. Carefully insert the brushes and brush springs into their holders. Gently place the armature back into the motor housing, ensuring it spins freely. Reattach the end bells, tightening the screws securely but not over-tightening. Double-check that all parts are properly aligned and secured before reinstalling the motor into your RC car.  Before you hit the track, spin the motor by hand to ensure everything is moving smoothly.

## Frequently Asked Questions About RC Motor Cleaning

**Q: How often should I clean my brushed RC motor?**
A: It depends on your usage and environment. Generally, cleaning every 20-30 runs or whenever you notice a decrease in performance is a good practice.

**Q: Can I use water to clean my RC motor?**
A: No, water can cause corrosion and short circuits. Always use isopropyl alcohol or a dedicated motor cleaner.

**Q: What if my motor still runs poorly after cleaning?**
A: Check the brushes for wear, ensure the commutator is clean, and verify that the motor is properly lubricated. If problems persist, the motor may have internal damage.

**Q: Is it difficult to replace the brushes in an RC motor?**
A: It's a relatively simple process, but requires careful handling of small parts. Many online tutorials can guide you through the process.

**Q: What type of isopropyl alcohol should I use?**
A: Use 90% or higher isopropyl alcohol for effective cleaning and quick evaporation.
