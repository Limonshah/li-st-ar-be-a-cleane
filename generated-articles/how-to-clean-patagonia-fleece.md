## How To Clean Patagonia Fleece: A Simple Guide

Is your trusty Patagonia fleece starting to look a little…loved? Don't worry, restoring its cozy softness is easier than you think. Patagonia fleece is known for its durability and warmth, but proper cleaning is key to maintaining its performance and extending its lifespan. This article will walk you through everything you need to know about how to clean Patagonia fleece, from everyday washing to tackling stubborn stains. We’ll cover the best detergents, washing machine settings, and drying techniques to keep your fleece in top condition. Let's dive in and get your fleece feeling fresh again!

**Takeaway:**

*   Wash your Patagonia fleece inside out in cold water.
*   Use a mild, liquid detergent – avoid fabric softeners and bleach.
*   Tumble dry on low heat or hang to dry.
*   Avoid ironing, as it can damage the fibers.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean Patagonia fleece, turn it inside out and machine wash in cold water with a mild detergent. Tumble dry on low heat or hang to dry. Avoid fabric softeners and bleach to maintain the fleece’s performance and softness.

## Why Proper Fleece Cleaning Matters

Patagonia fleece isn’t just a comfortable layer; it’s an investment. Taking the time to clean it correctly protects that investment. Unlike some fabrics, fleece can trap dirt and oils within its fibers, which can reduce its insulating properties over time. Regular cleaning removes these contaminants, ensuring your fleece continues to provide optimal warmth. Plus, proper care prevents pilling and maintains the fleece’s soft texture, keeping it looking great for years to come. 

## Choosing the Right Detergent for Patagonia Fleece

Selecting the right detergent is crucial for preserving the quality of your Patagonia fleece. Harsh chemicals can break down the fibers and diminish its performance. Always opt for a mild, liquid detergent specifically designed for delicate fabrics. Avoid detergents containing enzymes, bleach, or fabric softeners. These additives can leave residue that attracts dirt and reduces the fleece’s ability to wick moisture.

## Machine Washing Your Patagonia Fleece: Step-by-Step

Machine washing is the most convenient way to clean your Patagonia fleece, but it’s important to do it correctly. First, turn the fleece inside out to protect the outer surface. Next, place it in the washing machine with similar colors. Use a cold water cycle and a gentle wash setting. Add a small amount of your chosen mild detergent. Avoid overloading the washing machine, as this can prevent the fleece from being thoroughly cleaned. Once the wash cycle is complete, proceed to the drying stage.

## Drying Your Patagonia Fleece: Low Heat or Air Dry?

How you dry your Patagonia fleece is just as important as how you wash it. High heat can cause the fibers to shrink and become damaged. The best option is to tumble dry on low heat. Alternatively, you can hang your fleece to air dry. If you choose to air dry, lay it flat or hang it on a wide hanger to maintain its shape. Avoid direct sunlight, as this can fade the color. Remember, patience is key – allowing your fleece to dry completely prevents mildew and odors.

## Tackling Stubborn Stains on Your Patagonia Fleece

Life happens, and sometimes your Patagonia fleece will encounter stains. Addressing these stains promptly increases your chances of successful removal. For oil-based stains, try applying a small amount of dish soap directly to the stain and gently rubbing it in before washing. For mud or dirt, let it dry completely and then brush it off before washing. If you're dealing with a particularly stubborn stain, consider using a specialized stain remover designed for synthetic fabrics.

## Extending the Life of Your Patagonia Fleece: Preventative Care

Beyond regular cleaning, preventative care can significantly extend the life of your Patagonia fleece. Avoid wearing your fleece while engaging in activities that could expose it to harsh chemicals or abrasive surfaces. Store your fleece in a cool, dry place when not in use. Consider using a garment bag to protect it from dust and moths. Regularly brushing your fleece can also help prevent pilling and maintain its soft texture. Taking these simple steps will ensure your Patagonia fleece remains a reliable companion for years to come.



## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q: Can I use fabric softener when washing my Patagonia fleece?**

A: No, you should avoid using fabric softener. Fabric softener coats the fibers of your fleece, reducing its breathability and ability to wick moisture. This can compromise its performance and make it less comfortable to wear.

**Q: How often should I wash my Patagonia fleece?**

A: Wash your Patagonia fleece as needed, typically after several wears or when it starts to lose its loft or develop an odor. Overwashing can wear down the fibers, so only wash it when necessary.

**Q: Can I iron my Patagonia fleece?**

A: No, ironing is not recommended. The heat from an iron can melt or damage the synthetic fibers of the fleece. If you need to remove wrinkles, try hanging the fleece in a steamy bathroom.

**Q: What if my Patagonia fleece pills after washing?**

A: Pilling is a natural occurrence with fleece fabrics. You can remove pills using a fabric shaver or a sweater comb. Preventative care, such as gentle washing and avoiding abrasive surfaces, can help minimize pilling.

**Q: Is it okay to dry clean my Patagonia fleece?**

A: While some Patagonia fleeces *can* be dry cleaned, it's generally not recommended. The harsh chemicals used in dry cleaning can damage the fibers. Machine washing with the proper care is usually the better option.
