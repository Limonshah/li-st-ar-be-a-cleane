## Keeping Your Little Green Machine Fresh: A Complete Cleaning Guide

Is your Bissell Little Green Machine losing suction or just not performing as well as it used to? Regular cleaning is the key to keeping this powerful little spot cleaner working effectively for years. This article will walk you through a comprehensive cleaning process, ensuring your Little Green Machine tackles messes with ease. Weâ€™ll cover everything from emptying the tanks to deep cleaning the internal components, so you can restore its cleaning power. Let's dive in and get your machine sparkling!

**Takeaway:**

*   Empty and rinse both tanks after *every* use.
*   Clean the brush roll regularly to remove hair and debris.
*   Deep clean the machine monthly with a vinegar solution.
*   Inspect and clean the spray nozzle for clogs.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean your Little Green Machine, empty and rinse both the clean and dirty water tanks after each use. Regularly clean the brush roll and hose, and perform a deep clean monthly with a diluted vinegar solution to prevent buildup and maintain optimal performance.

## Why Cleaning Your Little Green Machine Matters

Your Bissell Little Green Machine is a workhorse when it comes to tackling spills and stains. But like any machine, it needs regular maintenance to stay in top condition. Over time, dirt, pet hair, and cleaning solutions can build up inside the tanks, hose, and brush roll, reducing suction and potentially damaging the motor. A clean machine not only performs better but also lasts longer, saving you money in the long run. Plus, a hygienic machine ensures you're not spreading old dirt and bacteria around your home.

## Emptying and Rinsing the Tanks After Each Use

This is the *most* important step in maintaining your Little Green Machine. After every cleaning session, immediately empty both the clean and dirty water tanks. Rinse them thoroughly with clean water to remove any remaining solution or debris. Leaving dirty water sitting in the tanks can lead to mold and mildew growth, and can also damage the internal components.  A quick rinse takes only a minute, but it makes a huge difference in the longevity of your machine.

## Cleaning the Brush Roll and Foot

The brush roll is responsible for scrubbing away dirt and stains, so it's bound to collect a lot of debris. Regularly inspect the brush roll for tangled hair, threads, and other particles. You can easily remove these by hand or with a small pair of scissors.  A clogged brush roll significantly reduces cleaning effectiveness.  Also, wipe down the foot of the machine with a damp cloth to remove any residue.  Consider removing the brush roll periodically for a more thorough cleaning, ensuring all sides are free of buildup.

### Removing Stubborn Debris from the Brush Roll

Sometimes, debris gets tightly wrapped around the brush roll. For these stubborn cases, try using a seam ripper or a small hook to carefully remove the tangled material. Avoid using sharp objects that could damage the bristles.  If the brush roll is particularly dirty, you can wash it with mild soap and water, ensuring it's completely dry before reinstalling it.

## Deep Cleaning the Little Green Machine: A Monthly Routine

While rinsing the tanks after each use is crucial, a monthly deep clean is essential for removing hidden buildup. Fill the clean water tank with a solution of equal parts white vinegar and warm water. Run the machine for a few minutes, spraying the solution through the hose and nozzle. This will help dissolve mineral deposits and sanitize the internal components.  Then, empty the dirty water tank and rinse both tanks thoroughly with clean water.

## Cleaning the Hose and Spray Nozzle

The hose and spray nozzle can become clogged with dirt and debris, reducing water flow and suction. To clean the hose, detach it from the machine and flush it with warm water. You can also use a long brush to scrub the inside of the hose. For the spray nozzle, inspect it for any blockages. Use a small pin or needle to carefully clear any clogs.  A clear nozzle ensures a consistent and powerful spray. [You can also find tips on how to clean the Bissell Little Green head](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bissell-little-green-head).

### Dealing with Persistent Hose Clogs

If the hose remains clogged after flushing, try soaking it in a solution of warm water and baking soda for a few hours. This can help loosen stubborn debris.  Alternatively, you can use a hose cleaning tool specifically designed for this purpose.  Always ensure the hose is completely dry before reattaching it to the machine.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues & Maintenance Tips

Sometimes, even with regular cleaning, you might encounter issues with your Little Green Machine. Here are a few common problems and how to address them:

*   **Reduced Suction:** Check for clogs in the hose, nozzle, and brush roll. Also, ensure the dirty water tank isn't overfilled.
*   **Leaking:** Inspect the tanks and hose for cracks or damage. Tighten all connections.
*   **Unusual Noise:** This could indicate a problem with the motor. Discontinue use and contact Bissell customer support.
*   **Smelly Machine:** Deep clean with a vinegar solution and ensure the tanks are thoroughly rinsed and dried after each use.

Regular maintenance, like these checks, will keep your Little Green Machine running smoothly.
