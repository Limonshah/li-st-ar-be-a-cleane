## Keeping Your Engine Breathing: How Often To Clean An AEM Dryflow Filter

Is your engine feeling sluggish? A dirty air filter could be the culprit. The AEM Dryflow filter is a popular choice for performance enthusiasts, offering excellent airflow. But unlike disposable paper filters, it requires regular cleaning to maintain that performance. This article will guide you through everything you need to know about cleaning your AEM Dryflow filter, ensuring your engine gets the clean air it needs. We’ll cover cleaning frequency, the cleaning process, and what to expect.

**Takeaway:**

*   Clean your AEM Dryflow filter every 25,000 - 50,000 miles.
*   Inspect the filter more frequently in dusty or off-road conditions.
*   Use AEM’s dedicated filter cleaning kit for best results.
*   Proper cleaning extends the filter’s lifespan and maintains engine performance.

**How often should you clean an AEM Dryflow filter?**

Generally, you should clean your AEM Dryflow filter every 25,000 to 50,000 miles. However, driving conditions play a huge role. If you frequently drive in dusty, dirty, or off-road environments, you’ll need to clean it much more often – potentially every 10,000 to 20,000 miles.

### Understanding the AEM Dryflow Filter

The AEM Dryflow filter uses a unique filtration technology. It’s constructed from multiple layers of oiled, cotton-gauze material. This design allows for a high volume of airflow while still trapping harmful dirt and debris. Unlike traditional paper filters that are discarded, the AEM Dryflow filter is reusable, making it an environmentally friendly and cost-effective option.

### Why Regular Cleaning is Crucial

A dirty air filter restricts airflow to your engine. This restriction can lead to several problems, including reduced horsepower, decreased fuel efficiency, and even engine damage. When the filter becomes clogged, your engine has to work harder to draw in air, which strains the engine components. Regular cleaning ensures optimal airflow, protecting your engine and maximizing performance.

### Determining When to Clean Your Filter: Visual Inspection

Don’t rely solely on mileage. Regularly inspect your AEM Dryflow filter visually. Remove the filter from the airbox and hold it up to a light source. If you can’t easily see light through the filter material, it’s time for a cleaning. Look for excessive dirt, dust, or debris buildup. A heavily soiled filter will significantly restrict airflow.

### The Cleaning Process: Step-by-Step Guide

Cleaning an AEM Dryflow filter is a straightforward process. You’ll need the AEM Dryflow Filter Cleaning Kit, which includes a cleaner and a filter oil. 

1.  **Remove the Filter:** Carefully remove the filter from the airbox.
2.  **Apply Cleaner:** Generously spray the AEM Dryflow Filter Cleaner onto the dirty side of the filter.
3.  **Let it Soak:** Allow the cleaner to soak for 10-20 minutes, breaking down the dirt and grime.
4.  **Rinse:** Gently rinse the filter with low-pressure water, spraying from the clean side to the dirty side. Avoid using high-pressure water, as it can damage the filter material.
5.  **Dry:** Allow the filter to air dry completely. Do *not* use compressed air or heat to speed up the drying process.
6.  **Oil:** Once dry, evenly apply AEM Dryflow Filter Oil to the filter.
7.  **Reinstall:** Reinstall the filter into the airbox.

### Choosing the Right Cleaning Products

Using the correct cleaning products is essential. AEM’s dedicated filter cleaning kit is specifically formulated for their Dryflow filters. Avoid using harsh chemicals, solvents, or detergents, as these can damage the filter material and reduce its effectiveness. Using the wrong products can compromise the filter’s ability to trap dirt and debris.

### What to Expect After Cleaning

After cleaning and oiling your AEM Dryflow filter, you might notice a slight decrease in airflow initially. This is normal as the oil needs to distribute evenly throughout the filter material. After a short break-in period (typically 50-100 miles), the airflow will return to optimal levels. You should also experience improved engine performance and fuel efficiency.

### Extending the Life of Your AEM Dryflow Filter

Proper maintenance can significantly extend the life of your AEM Dryflow filter. Avoid over-oiling the filter, as this can attract more dirt. Regularly inspect the filter for any tears or damage. If you notice any damage, replace the filter immediately. A damaged filter can allow dirt and debris to enter your engine, causing serious problems.

### Cleaning Frequency Based on Driving Conditions

As mentioned earlier, driving conditions significantly impact cleaning frequency. Here’s a more detailed breakdown:

*   **Normal Highway Driving:** Clean every 30,000 - 50,000 miles.
*   **City Driving:** Clean every 20,000 - 30,000 miles.
*   **Dusty/Off-Road Driving:** Clean every 10,000 - 20,000 miles, or more frequently if needed.
*   **Track Days/Racing:** Clean after *every* track day or racing event.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can I use soap and water to clean my AEM Dryflow filter?**

A: No, avoid using soap and water. Soap can leave residue that attracts dirt and reduces the filter’s effectiveness. Always use AEM’s dedicated filter cleaner.

**Q: How much oil should I apply to the filter?**

A: Apply enough oil to evenly coat the filter material, but avoid over-oiling. The filter should be slightly tacky to the touch, but not dripping with oil.

**Q: Can I reuse the cleaning kit for multiple filters?**

A: Yes, the AEM Dryflow Filter Cleaning Kit can be used for multiple filters, but the cleaner will eventually lose its effectiveness. Monitor the cleaner’s performance and replace it when necessary.

**Q: What happens if I don’t clean my filter regularly?**

A: A dirty filter restricts airflow, leading to reduced horsepower, decreased fuel efficiency, and potential engine damage.

**Q: Is it okay to clean my filter more often than recommended?**

A: Yes, cleaning your filter more often than recommended is perfectly fine, especially if you drive in harsh conditions. It’s better to err on the side of caution.
