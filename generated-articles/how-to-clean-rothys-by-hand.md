## How To Clean Rothy'S By Hand: A Step-by-Step Guide

Are your beloved Rothy’s looking a little less than fresh? Don't worry, keeping these comfortable and stylish shoes clean doesn’t require a trip to the dry cleaner. This guide will show you exactly [how to clean Rothy’s by hand](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-rothys-by-hand), ensuring they stay looking their best for years to come. We’ll cover everything from quick spot cleaning to a more thorough hand wash, keeping your sustainable footwear in top condition. Let's dive in and restore your Rothy's to their original glory!

**Takeaway:**

*   Gentle hand washing is best for Rothy’s.
*   Mild detergent and cool water are key.
*   Air drying is crucial to maintain shape.
*   Regular cleaning prevents dirt buildup.

**Can you wash Rothy’s by hand?**

Yes, you absolutely can wash Rothy’s by hand! In fact, it’s the recommended method by Rothy’s themselves. Hand washing preserves the integrity of the knit material and prevents damage that a washing machine could cause.

## Understanding Your Rothy’s Material

Rothy’s are made from recycled plastic bottles, creating a unique knit fabric. This material is surprisingly durable, but it still requires gentle care. Knowing what your shoes are made of is the first step to properly cleaning them. Unlike leather shoes that require specific conditioners, Rothy’s respond well to a simple soap and water solution. 

The knit construction means dirt can sometimes get trapped within the fibers, so a little extra attention is needed.  Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the delicate material.

## Quick Spot Cleaning for Everyday Dirt

Sometimes, a full wash isn’t necessary. For small marks or scuffs, spot cleaning is a quick and effective solution. This is perfect for addressing minor messes before they become bigger problems. 

Here’s how to spot clean your Rothy’s:

*   **Mix a mild solution:** Combine a tiny drop of gentle detergent (like dish soap or laundry detergent) with cool water.
*   **Apply gently:** Dip a soft cloth into the solution and gently dab at the stain. Avoid rubbing vigorously.
*   **Rinse:** Use a clean, damp cloth to rinse away any soap residue.
*   **Air dry:** Allow the shoe to air dry completely, away from direct heat.

This method is ideal for tackling everyday dirt and grime, keeping your Rothy’s looking fresh between washes.

## The Complete Hand Washing Process

For a more thorough clean, a full hand wash is the way to go. This is best done when your Rothy’s are visibly dirty or have been exposed to more significant messes.  Remember, gentle is key throughout the entire process.

Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Prepare your solution:** Fill a basin or sink with cool water and add a small amount of mild detergent.
2.  **Submerge and soak:** Gently submerge your Rothy’s in the soapy water and let them soak for about 10-15 minutes.
3.  **Gentle agitation:** Gently agitate the shoes in the water, paying attention to areas with visible dirt. Avoid harsh scrubbing.
4.  **Rinse thoroughly:** Rinse the shoes thoroughly under cool, running water until all soap residue is gone.
5.  **Remove excess water:** Gently squeeze out excess water – *do not* wring or twist the shoes.
6.  **Air dry:** Allow the shoes to air dry completely, away from direct sunlight or heat. Stuffing them with paper towels can help maintain their shape.

## Drying Your Rothy’s Properly

Proper drying is crucial to prevent damage and maintain the shape of your Rothy’s. Avoid using a dryer, as the heat can shrink or distort the material.  Direct sunlight can also fade the colors.

Here are some tips for drying your Rothy’s:

*   **Air dry only:** Always air dry your Rothy’s.
*   **Stuff with paper towels:** Stuffing the shoes with paper towels helps them retain their shape while drying.
*   **Avoid direct heat:** Keep them away from radiators, heaters, or direct sunlight.
*   **Allow ample time:**  It can take up to 24 hours for Rothy’s to dry completely.

Taking the time to dry your Rothy’s correctly will ensure they last longer and continue to look great.

## Dealing with Stubborn Stains

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, stubborn stains remain. For these, a little extra attention is needed.  Don't panic – there are ways to tackle even the toughest marks.

Here are a few tips:

*   **Baking soda paste:** For tough stains, create a paste of baking soda and water. Gently apply to the stain, let it sit for a few minutes, then rinse thoroughly.
*   **White vinegar:** Diluted white vinegar can also help lift stains. Test in an inconspicuous area first.
*   **Repeat washing:** If the stain persists, repeat the hand washing process.
*   **Professional cleaning:** For extremely stubborn stains, consider consulting a professional shoe cleaner.

Remember to always test any cleaning solution in a hidden area of the shoe first to ensure it doesn’t cause discoloration.

## Maintaining Your Rothy’s: Preventative Care

Preventative care is the best way to keep your Rothy’s looking their best.  A little effort can go a long way in extending their lifespan and reducing the need for frequent cleaning.

Here are some tips:

*   **Rotate your shoes:** Don’t wear the same pair of Rothy’s every day. Rotating your shoes allows them to air out and recover.
*   **Use a shoe protector:** Consider using a shoe protector spray to repel water and dirt.
*   **Clean regularly:** Wipe down your Rothy’s with a damp cloth after each wear to remove surface dirt.
*   **Store properly:** Store your Rothy’s in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.

Taking these simple steps will help keep your Rothy’s looking fresh and new for years to come.  You can also apply these principles to other footwear – learning [how to clean leather shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-leather-shoes) can help you maintain a whole collection.
