## Cleaning Shellac From Your Airless Sprayer: A Step-by-Step Guide

Have you recently used shellac in your airless sprayer and are now facing the sticky situation of cleaning it out? Shellac, while a fantastic finish, can be notoriously difficult to remove if it dries within your sprayer. This guide will walk you through the process of effectively cleaning shellac from your airless sprayer, ensuring it’s ready for your next project. We’ll cover everything from initial flushing to detailed component cleaning, keeping your equipment in top shape.

**Takeaway:**

*   Use denatured alcohol as your primary cleaning solvent.
*   Flush the system thoroughly before disassembling.
*   Clean all components – tip, guard, hose, and pump – individually.
*   Proper cleaning prevents clogs and extends sprayer life.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean shellac from an airless sprayer, flush the system with denatured alcohol, disassemble the key components, soak them in alcohol, and scrub away any remaining residue.  Always follow the manufacturer’s safety guidelines when working with solvents.

## Why Shellac Requires Special Cleaning Attention

Shellac is a unique coating, unlike water-based paints or lacquers. It’s a resin secreted by the lac beetle, dissolved in alcohol. This means water won’t effectively break it down. Trying to clean dried shellac with water will only make the problem worse, causing it to become gummy and even more difficult to remove.  Therefore, a solvent-based approach is essential.  Understanding this difference is the first step to successful shellac removal from your airless sprayer.  Ignoring this can lead to costly repairs or even the need to replace your sprayer.

## The Best Solvent for Shellac: Denatured Alcohol

Denatured alcohol is the key to dissolving shellac. It’s the same solvent used to *thin* shellac, so it naturally breaks it down effectively. Avoid using other solvents like lacquer thinner or acetone, as they can damage the seals and components of your airless sprayer.  Always work in a well-ventilated area when using denatured alcohol, and wear appropriate safety gear, including gloves and a respirator.  Using the correct solvent is crucial for a safe and effective cleaning process.

## Flushing Your Airless Sprayer with Denatured Alcohol

Before you start disassembling anything, flush your airless sprayer with denatured alcohol. This removes the bulk of the shellac and makes the detailed cleaning much easier. 

1.  Pour a generous amount of denatured alcohol into your paint container.
2.  Set your sprayer to a low-pressure setting.
3.  Spray the alcohol through the system until it runs clear.
4.  Repeat this process several times, using fresh alcohol each time. 
5.  This initial flush significantly reduces the amount of shellac you’ll need to scrub away later.  For more information on general sprayer cleaning, check out this guide on [how to clean a paint sprayer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-paint-sprayer).

## Disassembling and Cleaning Key Components

Once you’ve flushed the system, it’s time to disassemble and clean the individual components. This ensures no shellac residue remains hidden, causing future problems.

### The Spray Tip and Guard

The spray tip is often the first place shellac builds up. Remove the tip and guard and soak them in denatured alcohol for at least 30 minutes. Use a small brush or toothpick to gently scrub away any remaining shellac.  Pay close attention to the tiny orifices of the tip, as these are easily clogged.  A clogged tip will result in uneven spray patterns and reduced performance.

### The Suction Tube and Filter

Remove the suction tube and filter from the paint container.  These components draw the shellac from the container, so they’re likely to be coated.  Soak them in denatured alcohol and use a brush to clean away any residue.  Ensure the filter is completely clean, as any blockage here will restrict the flow of shellac.  Regular filter cleaning is a vital part of maintaining your sprayer.

### The Hose

Disconnect the hose from the sprayer and flush it thoroughly with denatured alcohol. You can use a hose flushing kit or simply run alcohol through it using a pump.  Ensure all the alcohol drains out before reattaching the hose.  A clean hose ensures a consistent flow of material and prevents clogs.

### The Pump

The pump is the heart of your airless sprayer, and it requires careful cleaning. Consult your sprayer’s manual for specific instructions on how to access and clean the pump. Typically, you’ll need to run denatured alcohol through the pump while it’s operating at a low speed. This helps to dissolve any shellac that has accumulated inside.  Be extremely careful when working with the pump, as it contains high-pressure components.

## Final Flushing and Reassembly

After cleaning all the components, reassemble your airless sprayer. Before using it with another material, flush the system one last time with denatured alcohol to ensure all traces of shellac are removed.  This final flush is a crucial step to prevent contamination of your next project.  Once you’re confident the sprayer is clean, you can proceed with your next coating application.

## Preventing Future Shellac Build-Up

Preventing shellac build-up is always easier than cleaning it up. Here are a few tips:

*   **Clean immediately:** Don’t let shellac dry in your sprayer. Clean it as soon as you’re finished with your project.
*   **Use a strainer:** Place a strainer over the paint container opening to catch any shellac flakes or debris.
*   **Regular maintenance:** Perform regular maintenance on your airless sprayer, including cleaning and lubricating the components.
*   **Proper storage:** Store your sprayer in a clean, dry place when not in use.



## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q: Can I use water to clean shellac out of my airless sprayer?**

A: No, water will cause shellac to become gummy and even harder to remove. Denatured alcohol is the only effective solvent for dissolving shellac.

**Q: How long should I soak the sprayer components in denatured alcohol?**

A: At least 30 minutes is recommended, but longer soaking times (up to a few hours) can be beneficial for heavily coated components.

**Q: Is denatured alcohol safe to use?**

A: Denatured alcohol is flammable and can be harmful if inhaled or ingested. Always work in a well-ventilated area, wear gloves and a respirator, and follow the manufacturer’s safety guidelines.

**Q: What if I still have shellac residue after cleaning?**

A: Repeat the cleaning process, soaking the components for a longer period and using a brush to scrub away any remaining residue. You may need to use fresh denatured alcohol.

**Q: Can I use the same denatured alcohol multiple times?**

A: While technically possible, it's best to use fresh denatured alcohol for each cleaning cycle. Used alcohol will contain dissolved shellac and will be less effective.



## Conclusion

Cleaning shellac out of an airless sprayer requires a specific approach, primarily relying on denatured alcohol to dissolve the resin. By following the steps outlined in this guide – flushing, disassembling, cleaning, and reassembling – you can ensure your sprayer remains in optimal working condition.
