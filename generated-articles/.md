## Daily Cleaning Tasks: Small Efforts, Big Impact

Starting your day with a few quick cleaning tasks can prevent messes from piling up. These small efforts make a huge difference in the overall cleanliness of your home.  Think of it as preventative maintenance – a little bit each day saves a lot of work later.  

*   **Make the bed:** This instantly makes a bedroom look tidier.
*   **Wipe kitchen counters and sink:** After each meal, wipe down surfaces to prevent food buildup.
*   **Sweep kitchen floor:**  Quickly sweep up crumbs and spills.

## Weekly Cleaning: The Core of Your Routine

Weekly cleaning tackles the tasks that keep your home consistently clean and hygienic. This is where you focus on the areas that get the most use and are prone to dirt and grime.  Don't try to do everything at once; break it down into smaller chunks throughout the week.

*   **Clean bathrooms:** Scrub toilets, sinks, showers, and floors.
*   **Vacuum or mop floors:**  Remove dirt, dust, and debris from all flooring surfaces.
*   **Dust surfaces:**  Dust furniture, shelves, and other surfaces.
