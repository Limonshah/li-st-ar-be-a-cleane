## Daily Cleaning Tasks: The 15-Minute Reset

Starting your day with a quick tidy-up, or ending it with a 15-minute reset, can dramatically reduce overall cleaning time. These small habits prevent messes from escalating.  Think of it as preventative maintenance for your home.  A little effort each day means less work later on. 

*   **Make beds:** A made bed instantly makes a room look tidier.
*   **Wipe kitchen counters and sink:**  After each meal, wipe down surfaces to prevent food buildup.
*   **Sweep kitchen floor:** Quickly sweep up crumbs and spills.
*   **Do a quick dish wash:** Don't let dishes pile up in the sink.
*   **Wipe down bathroom counters:** A quick wipe keeps surfaces sanitary.

## Weekly Cleaning: The Core Routine

Weekly cleaning is where you tackle the areas that get the most use and accumulate dirt quickly. This is your core cleaning routine, and consistency is key.  Don't try to do everything at once; break it down into manageable chunks.  Consider dedicating specific days to specific rooms.
