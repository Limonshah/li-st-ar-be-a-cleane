## Revitalize Your Kicks: How to Clean Sneakers in the Washing Machine

Learning [how to clean sneakers in the washing machine](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-sneakers-in-the-washing-machine) is a quick, easy, and effective way to restore them to their former glory. This method saves you time and effort compared to hand-washing, and can breathe new life into your footwear. This article will guide you through the entire process, from preparation to drying, ensuring your sneakers come out looking fresh and clean. We’ll cover everything you need to know to safely and effectively wash your sneakers without causing damage.

**Takeaway:**

*   Remove laces and insoles before washing.

*   Air dry completely – avoid the dryer!

**Can you really wash sneakers in the washing machine?**

Yes, you can! Many sneakers can be safely cleaned in a washing machine, but it's crucial to follow the right steps to avoid damage. This method is best for canvas, nylon, and synthetic leather sneakers.



## Preparing Your Sneakers for a Wash

Before you toss your sneakers into the washing machine, a little preparation goes a long way. Start by removing the laces and insoles. These should be washed separately to ensure a thorough clean.  Laces can be hand-washed with soap and water or placed in a mesh laundry bag and washed with the sneakers. Insoles can also be hand-washed and air-dried. 

Next, remove any loose dirt or debris from the sneakers using a soft brush. Pay attention to the soles and any heavily soiled areas.  This initial cleaning prevents the washing machine from spreading dirt around and makes the overall cleaning process more effective.  Finally, place each sneaker in a [mesh laundry bag](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-use-a-washing-machine) to protect them from damage during the wash cycle.



## Choosing the Right Wash Cycle and Detergent

Selecting the correct wash cycle and detergent is vital for protecting your sneakers. Always use a gentle or delicate cycle with cold water. Hot water can damage the materials and cause colors to fade.  Avoid using harsh detergents or bleach, as these can also be damaging. 

Instead, opt for a mild laundry detergent specifically designed for delicate fabrics.  A small amount of detergent is all you need – too much can leave residue on your sneakers. Consider adding a color-safe detergent to help preserve the vibrancy of your shoes.  If you're concerned about odors, you can add a cup of white vinegar to the wash cycle as a natural deodorizer.



## Washing Your Sneakers: A Step-by-Step Guide

Now that your sneakers are prepared, it's time to wash them! Place the bagged sneakers into the washing machine. To prevent the machine from banging around excessively, add a few old towels or rags to the drum. This helps balance the load and protects both your sneakers and your washing machine. 

Select the gentle cycle with cold water and add your mild detergent.  Start the washing machine and let it do its work. Once the wash cycle is complete, carefully remove the sneakers from the laundry bags.  Don't automatically put them in the dryer – air drying is the safest option.



## The Importance of Air Drying

Avoid the temptation to put your sneakers in the dryer! The heat can warp the shape, damage the materials, and even melt the glue.  Instead, allow your sneakers to air dry completely.  

Stuffing the sneakers with paper towels or newspaper helps them maintain their shape and absorb excess moisture. Place them in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight or heat.  Direct sunlight can cause colors to fade.  It may take several hours, or even a full day, for your sneakers to dry completely. Ensure they are fully dry before wearing them to prevent mildew growth.



## Dealing with Stubborn Stains

Sometimes, a regular wash isn't enough to remove stubborn stains. For these cases, pre-treating the stains before washing can be helpful.  A paste made from baking soda and water can effectively lift dirt and grime. 

Apply the paste to the stain, let it sit for 15-20 minutes, and then gently scrub with a soft brush. For tougher stains, you can try a specialized sneaker cleaner. Always test the cleaner on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn't damage the material.  After pre-treating, proceed with the washing machine steps outlined above.  If you have a particularly dirty washing machine, you might want to consider cleaning it – check out [how to clean mold from washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-from-washing-machine) for guidance.



## Maintaining Your Washing Machine for Optimal Cleaning

Keeping your washing machine clean is essential for ensuring your sneakers (and all your laundry) come out fresh and clean. Regularly clean the detergent dispenser and the rubber gasket to prevent mold and mildew growth.  Run an empty wash cycle with hot water and a cup of white vinegar every month to remove buildup and odors. 

Consider the type of washing machine you have. If you have a front-load washer, be sure to leave the door slightly ajar after each use to allow air circulation and prevent mildew.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can I wash all types of sneakers in the washing machine?**

**Q: How often can I wash my sneakers in the washing machine?**

A: Washing sneakers too frequently can shorten their lifespan. Only wash them when they are visibly dirty or have a strong odor. Spot cleaning is a good option for minor dirt.

**Q: What should I do if my sneakers come out smelling bad after washing?**

A: Ensure you're using enough detergent and consider adding a cup of white vinegar to the wash cycle.  If the odor persists, sprinkle baking soda inside the sneakers and let it sit overnight before airing them out.
