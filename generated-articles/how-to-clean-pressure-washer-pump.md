## Revitalize Your Power: How To Clean a Pressure Washer Pump

Is your pressure washer losing power or struggling to start? Often, the culprit isn’t a major malfunction, but a dirty pressure washer pump. A clean pump ensures efficient operation and extends the life of your machine. This guide will walk you through the process of cleaning your pressure washer pump, saving you money and frustration. We’ll cover everything from identifying issues to step-by-step cleaning instructions, ensuring your pressure washer delivers peak performance.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly flush the pump with clean water.
*   Use pump saver fluid during storage.
*   Inspect and clean the inlet filter frequently.
*   Address any leaks or unusual noises promptly.

A pressure washer pump is the heart of the machine, responsible for generating the high-pressure water stream. Cleaning it involves removing debris and buildup that can restrict water flow and damage internal components. 

## Why Cleaning Your Pressure Washer Pump Matters

Let's face it, nobody enjoys a failing machine. A dirty pressure washer pump can lead to a host of problems, impacting its performance and lifespan. Over time, mineral deposits, dirt, and debris can accumulate inside the pump, restricting water flow and causing reduced pressure. This buildup can also lead to overheating and premature wear of critical components like pistons and seals.  Regular cleaning prevents these issues, ensuring your pressure washer operates efficiently and reliably.  Ignoring pump maintenance can ultimately lead to costly repairs or even the need for a complete replacement.

## Identifying a Dirty Pressure Washer Pump

Before diving into cleaning, it’s important to recognize the signs of a dirty pump. Reduced water pressure is a primary indicator; if your pressure washer isn’t delivering the same cleaning power, the pump is likely clogged.  Another sign is difficulty starting the engine or motor. A struggling pump requires more effort to prime and build pressure.  Listen for unusual noises, such as rattling or grinding sounds, which can indicate debris interfering with the pump’s internal mechanisms. Finally, check for leaks around the pump housing – these can be a sign of damaged seals caused by buildup and pressure. If you notice any of these issues, it’s time to clean your pump.

## Gathering Your Supplies for Pump Cleaning

Preparation is key to a successful cleaning process. You won’t need a lot of specialized tools, which is great news! Here’s a list of what you’ll need:

*   **Garden Hose:** For flushing the pump.
*   **Bucket:** To collect the flushed water.
*   **Pump Saver Fluid:**  Essential for winterizing and long-term storage.
*   **Screwdrivers/Wrenches:** To access the pump inlet filter. (Check your manual for specific sizes).
*   **Soft Brush:** For cleaning the exterior of the pump.
*   **Safety Glasses:** Protect your eyes from splashing water and debris.
*   **Gloves:** To protect your hands.

Having these items readily available will streamline the cleaning process and ensure you can address any issues efficiently.  Don't forget to consult your pressure washer's manual for specific instructions related to your model.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Your Pressure Washer Pump

Now, let's get to the cleaning process. First, disconnect the pressure washer from the power source and water supply. Safety first! Next, locate the water inlet filter, usually found where the garden hose connects to the pump. Remove the filter and inspect it for debris. Clean the filter thoroughly with water and a soft brush.  

Then, connect your garden hose to the water inlet of the pump. Briefly pulse the trigger to flush out any loose debris.  Collect the flushed water in a bucket to observe any sediment or buildup. Repeat this process several times until the water runs clear.  Finally, after flushing, disconnect the hose and add pump saver fluid according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This protects the pump during storage and prevents corrosion.

## Maintaining a Clean Pump: Preventative Measures

Cleaning isn’t a one-time fix; preventative maintenance is crucial. Always use a garden hose filter to prevent debris from entering the pump.  After each use, flush the pump with clean water to remove any residual dirt or soap.  If you live in an area with hard water, consider using a water softener or descaling solution periodically to prevent mineral buildup.  During winter storage, always use pump saver fluid to protect the pump from freezing and corrosion.  Regularly inspect the pump for leaks or unusual noises, addressing any issues promptly.  Proper maintenance will significantly extend the life of your pressure washer and keep it running at peak performance.

## Troubleshooting Common Pump Issues

Even with regular cleaning, you might encounter some pump-related issues. If your pump isn’t building pressure, check the inlet filter for clogs and ensure the water supply is adequate.  If the pump is leaking, inspect the seals and replace them if necessary.  Unusual noises could indicate internal damage, requiring professional repair.  If your pressure washer is shutting off unexpectedly, it could be a thermal overload issue or a problem with the unloader valve.  Consult your pressure washer’s manual for specific troubleshooting steps.  If you're unsure about any repairs, it’s always best to seek assistance from a qualified technician.  Remember, maintaining a clean pump is the first step in preventing many of these issues.
