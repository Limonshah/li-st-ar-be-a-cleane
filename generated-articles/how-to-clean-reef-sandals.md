This article will walk you through everything you need to know to effectively clean your Reef sandals, keeping them looking and feeling great for years to come. We’ll cover everything from a quick rinse to tackling stubborn dirt and grime. Let's dive in and get those Reefs sparkling!

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular rinsing after use prevents buildup.
*   Mild soap and a soft brush are your best friends.
*   Air drying is crucial to avoid damage.
*   Specific materials (like leather) require specialized care.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean Reef sandals, simply rinse them with water after each use. For a deeper clean, use mild soap, a soft brush, and scrub gently. Rinse thoroughly and allow to air dry away from direct sunlight.

## Understanding Your Reef Sandals: Materials Matter

Before you start cleaning, it’s important to know what your Reef sandals are made of. Reef uses a variety of materials, including EVA foam, rubber, and sometimes leather or fabric. Knowing the material will help you choose the right cleaning method. Most Reef sandals feature their signature EVA footbed, which is relatively easy to clean. However, different materials require different approaches to avoid damage. For example, leather needs a different cleaning process than rubber. 

If you're unsure about the material, check the label inside your sandals or visit the Reef website for specific product information. Understanding the composition of your sandals is the first step towards effective and safe cleaning.

## The Daily Rinse: Preventing Build-Up

The easiest way to keep your Reef sandals clean is to rinse them with water after each use. This simple step prevents dirt, sand, and salt from building up and becoming difficult to remove. A quick rinse, especially after a day at the beach or pool, can significantly extend the life of your sandals. This is particularly important if you've been wearing them in saltwater, as salt can be corrosive over time.

Think of it like washing your dishes – the longer food sits, the harder it is to clean. The same principle applies to your Reefs! A garden hose works well for a thorough rinse, but even a quick run under the tap is beneficial. This proactive approach minimizes the need for more intensive cleaning later on.

## Deep Cleaning Your Reef Sandals: Soap and Scrub

For a more thorough cleaning, you'll need mild soap and a soft-bristled brush. Dish soap or laundry detergent diluted in water works well. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the materials. Gently scrub the entire sandal, paying attention to the footbed, straps, and soles. 

Don't be afraid to get into the crevices where dirt tends to accumulate. A toothbrush can be helpful for reaching tight spots. Remember to scrub gently to avoid damaging the material. If you have stubborn stains, let the soapy water sit for a few minutes before scrubbing again. For particularly dirty footbeds, consider a specialized sandal cleaner, or check out tips for cleaning sandal footbeds at [https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-footbed-of-sandals](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-footbed-of-sandals).

### Dealing with Stubborn Stains

Sometimes, a simple soap and water scrub isn't enough. For stubborn stains, try a paste of baking soda and water. Apply the paste to the stain, let it sit for 15-20 minutes, and then scrub gently with a soft brush. Baking soda is a natural abrasive that can help lift stains without damaging the material. 

Another option is to use a magic eraser, but test it in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn't discolor the sandal. For oil-based stains, a degreasing dish soap may be necessary. Always rinse thoroughly after using any cleaning agent.

## Air Drying: The Key to Longevity

After cleaning, allow your Reef sandals to air dry completely. Avoid direct sunlight or heat, as this can cause the materials to crack or warp. Place them in a well-ventilated area, away from direct heat sources like radiators or fireplaces. Stuffing the sandals with paper towels can help them maintain their shape while drying.

Never put your Reef sandals in the washing machine or dryer, as this can cause significant damage. Air drying is the safest and most effective way to ensure your sandals dry properly and maintain their integrity. Proper drying prevents mold and mildew growth, keeping your sandals fresh and hygienic.

## Caring for Leather Reef Sandals

If your Reef sandals feature leather straps or footbeds, you'll need to take extra care when cleaning them. Leather requires specialized cleaning products to avoid drying out or cracking. Use a leather cleaner and conditioner specifically designed for footwear. Apply the cleaner with a soft cloth and gently wipe away dirt and grime. 

Follow up with a leather conditioner to restore moisture and prevent cracking. Avoid getting leather wet for extended periods, as this can damage the material.

## Maintaining Your Reefs: Preventative Measures

Beyond regular cleaning, there are a few things you can do to maintain your Reef sandals and keep them looking their best. Avoid wearing your sandals in harsh environments, such as construction sites or areas with corrosive chemicals. Store your sandals in a cool, dry place when not in use. 

Consider using a protective spray designed for footwear to repel water and stains. Regularly inspect your sandals for signs of wear and tear, and address any issues promptly. Taking these preventative measures will help extend the life of your Reef sandals and keep them looking great for years to come.
