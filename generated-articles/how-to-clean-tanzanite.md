**Quick Answer:**

To clean tanzanite, gently scrub it with warm water, mild dish soap, and a soft brush. Rinse thoroughly and dry with a soft, lint-free cloth. Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive materials to protect the stone’s delicate surface.

## Understanding Tanzanite and Its Cleaning Needs

Tanzanite, a blue-violet variety of zoisite, is a relatively new gemstone discovered in Tanzania. Its color is due to trace amounts of vanadium, and heat treatment is often used to enhance its blue hues. Because of its 6-7 hardness on the Mohs scale, it’s more susceptible to scratches and damage than harder gemstones like diamonds. This means you need to be careful when cleaning it. Regular cleaning is important, as dirt and oils can dull the stone’s brilliance, but harsh methods can cause damage. Knowing these characteristics will help you choose the right cleaning approach.

## Daily & Light Cleaning for Tanzanite

Keeping your tanzanite sparkling doesn’t always require a full cleaning session. A simple daily routine can prevent buildup and maintain its shine. Use a soft cloth, like microfiber, to gently wipe your tanzanite jewelry after each wear. This removes oils from your skin and any surface dust. You can also use a slightly damp cloth for a more thorough wipe-down. This quick habit will significantly reduce the need for deeper cleaning.

## Deep Cleaning Tanzanite at Home

For a more thorough clean, you can use a gentle soaking method. Fill a bowl with warm (not hot) water and add a few drops of mild dish soap. Let your tanzanite jewelry soak for 20-30 minutes. This loosens any dirt or grime. After soaking, use a very soft brush, like a baby toothbrush, to gently scrub the stone and setting. Be especially careful around any prongs or delicate details. Rinse the jewelry thoroughly under warm running water and dry it with a soft, lint-free cloth.

## What to Avoid When Cleaning Tanzanite

Certain cleaning methods can permanently damage your tanzanite. Harsh chemicals, like chlorine bleach, ammonia, and strong detergents, can discolor or erode the stone. Avoid using ultrasonic cleaners and steam cleaners, as the vibrations and heat can cause fractures. Abrasive cleaners and cloths, like scouring pads or rough brushes, will scratch the surface. It’s also best to avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight, as it can fade the color of tanzanite over time.

## Cleaning Tanzanite Jewelry with Settings

If your tanzanite is set in metal, like gold or silver, you need to consider the metal when cleaning. While tanzanite itself is sensitive, some metals require specific care. For gold settings, the same gentle soap and water method works well. For silver settings, you may need to use a silver polishing cloth after cleaning to remove any tarnish. Always ensure the cleaning solution is safe for both the tanzanite and the metal.

## Storing Tanzanite to Prevent Cleaning Needs

Proper storage can minimize the need for frequent cleaning. Store your tanzanite jewelry separately from other pieces to prevent scratches. A soft pouch or jewelry box with individual compartments is ideal. Avoid storing tanzanite in direct sunlight or humid environments. Regularly inspecting your jewelry and wiping it down after each wear will also help keep it clean and sparkling. Consider storing it with a silica gel packet to absorb any moisture.
