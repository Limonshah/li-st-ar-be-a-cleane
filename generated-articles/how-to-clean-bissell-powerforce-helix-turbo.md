## Keeping Your Bissell Powerforce Helix Turbo Clean

Is your Bissell Powerforce Helix Turbo losing suction? Don't worry, it's a common issue easily solved with regular cleaning! This guide will walk you through a complete cleaning process for your vacuum, ensuring it continues to effectively tackle dirt and debris. We’ll cover everything from emptying the dirt tank to cleaning the brush roll and filters, helping you maintain peak performance. Let's get started and restore your vacuum’s cleaning power.

**Takeaway:**

*   Empty the dirt tank after each use.
*   Clean the filters regularly (every 3 months or as needed).
*   Remove and clean the brush roll to eliminate hair and debris.
*   Check and clear any blockages in the hose and attachments.

**Quick Answer:** To clean your Bissell Powerforce Helix Turbo, empty the dirt tank, wash the filters, remove and clean the brush roll, and check for blockages in the hose. Regular maintenance ensures optimal suction and extends the life of your vacuum.

## 1. Emptying the Dirt Tank – A Simple First Step

Let's begin with the easiest part: emptying the dirt tank. This should be done after *every* use to maintain consistent suction. A full tank restricts airflow, reducing your vacuum’s effectiveness. Locate the dirt tank – it’s usually at the front or bottom of the vacuum.  Detach it by releasing the clips or latches.  Empty the contents into a trash can, and then reattach the tank securely.

## 2. Cleaning the Filters for Optimal Airflow

Filters are crucial for trapping fine dust and allergens. A clogged filter significantly reduces suction power. Your Bissell Powerforce Helix Turbo likely has multiple filters – a foam filter and a pleated filter are common.  Remove the filters according to your model’s instructions. Rinse the foam filter with warm water until the water runs clear. Allow it to air dry *completely* before reinstalling – a damp filter can damage the motor. The pleated filter should be tapped gently to remove loose dust, and can be replaced periodically.

## 3. Removing and Cleaning the Brush Roll – Tackle Hair and Debris

The brush roll is the workhorse of your vacuum, and it often gets tangled with hair, string, and other debris. This buildup reduces its effectiveness and can even damage the motor. First, unplug your vacuum! Then, locate the brush roll access panel, usually on the bottom of the vacuum head. Remove the brush roll and carefully use scissors or a seam ripper to cut away any tangled hair or string.  A clean brush roll spins freely and effectively agitates carpets for a deeper clean.

## 4. Checking and Clearing Hose and Attachments for Blockages

A blocked hose or attachment can also cause a loss of suction. Disconnect the hose from the vacuum body and any attachments. Visually inspect the hose for any visible obstructions. You can use a long, flexible object like a broom handle or a coat hanger (carefully!) to dislodge any blockages.  Check the attachments as well, ensuring they are clear of debris.  Don't force anything through the hose, as this could damage it.

## 5. Cleaning the Exterior of Your Bissell Powerforce Helix Turbo

While not directly related to suction, keeping the exterior of your vacuum clean is important for hygiene and aesthetics. Wipe down the vacuum body with a damp cloth and a mild cleaning solution. Avoid using abrasive cleaners, as they can scratch the plastic. Pay attention to the areas around the wheels and the dirt tank compartment, as these tend to accumulate dust and grime.  A clean vacuum is a more pleasant vacuum to use!

## 6. Deep Cleaning the Dirt Tank – Beyond Emptying

Sometimes, simply emptying the dirt tank isn’t enough. Over time, dust and grime can build up inside, creating odors and potentially affecting performance. Remove the dirt tank and wash it with warm, soapy water. Rinse thoroughly and allow it to air dry *completely* before reattaching it to the vacuum.  You can also use a mild disinfectant to eliminate any lingering odors.

## 7. Addressing Persistent Odors – Freshening Up Your Vacuum

If your Bissell Powerforce Helix Turbo still smells after cleaning, there are a few things you can try. Sprinkle a small amount of baking soda into the dirt tank and let it sit overnight. Baking soda is a natural odor absorber. You can also add a few drops of essential oil to a cotton ball and place it inside the dirt tank (make sure the oil doesn’t come into direct contact with the vacuum’s components).
