## Revitalize Your Relaxation: How To Clean A Hot Tub That Has Been Sitting

Is your hot tub looking a little worse for wear after sitting unused? Don't worry, you're not alone! Many hot tubs fall into disrepair after periods of inactivity. Cleaning a hot tub that has been sitting requires a bit more effort than regular maintenance, but it’s absolutely achievable. This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to get your spa sparkling clean and ready for relaxation. We’ll cover everything from draining and cleaning the shell to refilling and balancing the water. Let’s get started and bring your hot tub back to life!

**Takeaway:**

*   Drain the old water and thoroughly clean the shell.
*   Clean or replace the hot tub filter.
*   Refill with fresh water and balance the chemicals.
*   Shock the water to eliminate bacteria and algae.

**Quick Answer:** To clean a hot tub that has been sitting, drain the old water, clean the shell with a hot tub cleaner, clean or replace the filter, refill with fresh water, balance the chemicals, and shock the water to eliminate any bacteria or algae buildup.

## 1. Initial Drain and Assessment of Your Hot Tub

The first step in cleaning a neglected hot tub is to completely drain the old water. This water likely contains bacteria, algae, and other debris that have accumulated during its time sitting idle. Before you begin, turn off the power to the hot tub at the breaker to ensure safety. Locate the drain valve – it’s usually near the bottom of the tub. Attach a garden hose and direct the water to a suitable drainage area, avoiding plants and landscaping. 

Once drained, take a good look inside. Assess the condition of the shell and identify any visible mold, mildew, or grime. This initial assessment will help you determine the cleaning products and effort required. If the tub has been sitting for a very long time, you might notice a strong odor, which is a sign of significant bacterial growth. Don't worry, we can tackle that!

## 2. Cleaning the Hot Tub Shell

Now it’s time to clean the hot tub shell itself. Avoid using harsh abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the acrylic surface. Instead, opt for a hot tub shell cleaner specifically designed for this purpose. These cleaners are formulated to remove grime, oils, and buildup without causing damage. 

Spray the cleaner liberally over the entire interior surface of the hot tub. Let it sit for the recommended time (usually 10-15 minutes) to allow it to penetrate the dirt and grime. Then, use a soft cloth or sponge to scrub the shell, paying particular attention to areas with visible buildup. For stubborn stains, you might need to scrub a little harder, but always avoid abrasive materials. Rinse the shell thoroughly with clean water, ensuring all traces of the cleaner are removed.

## 3. Filter Cleaning: A Crucial Step

The filter is the heart of your hot tub’s cleaning system, and it’s likely clogged with debris after a period of inactivity. Remove the filter and inspect it for damage. If the filter is torn or severely damaged, it needs to be replaced. If it’s just dirty, you can attempt to clean it.

Rinse the filter thoroughly with a garden hose, using a nozzle to direct a strong stream of water between the pleats. For a deeper clean, you can soak the filter in a filter cleaning solution overnight. This will help remove oils, minerals, and other contaminants that rinsing alone won’t remove. After soaking, rinse the filter again and allow it to dry completely before reinstalling it.

## 4. Jet and Plumbing Line Cleaning

Over time, biofilm can build up inside the hot tub’s jets and plumbing lines. This biofilm is a slimy layer of bacteria that can cause odors and reduce the effectiveness of your sanitizer. To clean the jets and lines, you’ll need a plumbing line cleaner specifically designed for hot tubs. 

Follow the product instructions carefully. Typically, you’ll add the cleaner to the hot tub while it’s filled with water and run the jets for a specified period. This allows the cleaner to circulate through the plumbing lines, breaking down the biofilm. After the cleaning cycle is complete, drain the hot tub again and rinse the shell thoroughly.

## 5. Refilling and Balancing the Water Chemistry

Once the hot tub is clean, it’s time to refill it with fresh water. Use a pre-filter on your hose to remove any minerals or contaminants from the incoming water. As you fill the tub, test the water’s pH, alkalinity, and calcium hardness. These levels need to be balanced for optimal water quality and to protect your hot tub’s equipment.

Adjust the water chemistry as needed using appropriate hot tub chemicals. Aim for a pH between 7.2 and 7.8, an alkalinity between 80 and 120 ppm, and a calcium hardness between 150 and 250 ppm. Maintaining proper water balance is crucial for preventing corrosion, scaling, and cloudy water.

## 6. Shocking the Water for Sanitation

After refilling and balancing the water, it’s essential to shock the hot tub to eliminate any remaining bacteria or algae. Use a non-chlorine shock specifically designed for hot tubs. Follow the product instructions carefully, as the amount of shock needed will vary depending on the size of your hot tub.

After shocking, allow the water to circulate for at least 20 minutes before using the hot tub. Test the water again to ensure the sanitizer level is within the recommended range. If the water is cloudy, you may need to repeat the shocking process.

## 7. Ongoing Maintenance for a Sparkling Spa

Cleaning a hot tub that has been sitting is a more intensive process, but maintaining it afterward is relatively simple. Regular maintenance will prevent future buildup and keep your hot tub clean and inviting. 

*   Test and balance the water chemistry weekly.
*   Clean or replace the filter every 2-4 weeks.
*   Shock the water after each use or at least once a week.
*   Drain and refill the hot tub every 3-6 months.
*   Wipe down the shell regularly with a mild cleaner.



## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How often should I clean my hot tub if it’s not being used regularly?**
A: Even if your hot tub isn’t used frequently, it’s important to maintain the water chemistry and run the jets periodically to prevent stagnation and buildup. A thorough cleaning should be done every 3-6 months, even if the tub is not in use.

**Q: Can I use bleach to clean my hot tub?**
A: No, bleach is not recommended for cleaning hot tubs. It can damage the shell and plumbing, and it can also interfere with the water chemistry. Always use cleaners specifically designed for hot tubs.

**Q: What causes cloudy water in a hot tub?**
A: Cloudy water can be caused by a variety of factors, including imbalanced water chemistry, inadequate filtration, and the presence of bacteria or algae. Shocking the water and cleaning the filter are usually effective in clearing up cloudy water.

**Q: How do I prevent algae growth in my hot tub?**
A: Maintaining proper water chemistry, especially sanitizer levels, is the best way to prevent algae growth. Regularly shocking the water and cleaning the filter also help.
