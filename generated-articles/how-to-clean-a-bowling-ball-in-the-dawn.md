## Keeping Your Game Strong: How To Clean A Bowling Ball

Ever wonder how to keep your bowling ball performing at its best? A clean bowling ball grips the lane better, leading to more strikes and higher scores. This article will guide you through the process of cleaning your bowling ball using a readily available and effective solution: Dawn dish soap. We’ll cover everything from why cleaning is important to a step-by-step guide, ensuring your equipment stays in top condition. Let's dive in and learn how to clean a bowling ball in the dawn!

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning removes oil absorption, maintaining grip.
*   Dawn dish soap is a safe and effective cleaning agent.
*   Proper drying prevents damage to the ball’s surface.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals that can degrade the ball’s core.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean a bowling ball, soak it in warm water with a few drops of Dawn dish soap for 15-20 minutes. Gently scrub with a soft cloth, rinse thoroughly, and allow it to air dry completely before storing.

## Why Cleaning Your Bowling Ball Matters

Oil absorption is the biggest enemy of a bowling ball’s performance. As you bowl, the ball picks up lane oil, which fills the pores of the coverstock. This reduces the ball’s ability to grip the lane, resulting in less hook and lower scores. Think of it like trying to grip something covered in grease – it just slips! Regularly cleaning your bowling ball removes this absorbed oil, restoring its original grip and improving your game.  Consistent cleaning also extends the life of your ball, protecting its reactive resin coverstock.

## The Dawn Dish Soap Method: A Safe and Effective Choice

Many specialized bowling ball cleaners are available, but Dawn dish soap offers a surprisingly effective and affordable alternative. Dawn is designed to cut through grease, making it perfect for removing lane oil. It’s also gentle enough not to damage the ball’s coverstock, unlike some harsh chemicals.  However, it’s important to use *only* Dawn dish soap and avoid any variations with added lotions or moisturizers, as these can leave a residue.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Your Bowling Ball

Let’s get into the practical steps. This process is simple and can be done at home with minimal effort.

1.  **Prepare the Water:** Fill a clean sink or tub with warm (not hot!) water. Hot water can damage the ball’s surface.
2.  **Add the Soap:** Add 2-3 drops of Dawn dish soap to the water. More isn’t better; you want a gentle cleaning solution.
3.  **Soak the Ball:** Submerge the bowling ball in the soapy water and let it soak for 15-20 minutes. This allows the soap to penetrate and loosen the oil.
4.  **Gentle Scrubbing:** Using a soft cloth (microfiber is ideal), gently scrub the entire surface of the ball. Avoid abrasive scrubbers, as they can scratch the coverstock.
5.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse the ball thoroughly under warm water, ensuring all soap residue is removed. Any remaining soap can attract dirt and oil.
6.  **Dry Completely:** This is crucial! Allow the ball to air dry completely before storing it.  Do *not* use a towel to dry it, as this can leave lint and streaks.  A drying rack is helpful.

## Understanding Your Bowling Ball’s Coverstock

Different bowling balls have different coverstocks, and understanding yours is key to proper care. Reactive resin balls are the most common and benefit greatly from regular cleaning. Plastic or polyester balls are less porous and don’t absorb oil as quickly, so they require less frequent cleaning.  Urethane balls fall somewhere in between. Knowing your ball’s material will help you determine how often to clean it.  If you're unsure, check the manufacturer's recommendations.  Maintaining other sports equipment is also important; for example, you can learn how to clean a barbell [https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-barbell](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-barbell).

### How Often Should You Clean?

The frequency of cleaning depends on how often you bowl. 

*   **Casual Bowlers (1-2 times per week):** Clean your ball after every 5-10 games.
*   **Regular Bowlers (3+ times per week):** Clean your ball after every 2-3 games.
*   **Tournament Bowlers:** Clean your ball after every game or set.

## What *Not* To Do When Cleaning Your Bowling Ball

Just as important as knowing what *to* do is knowing what *not* to do.  Avoid these common mistakes:

*   **Harsh Chemicals:** Never use abrasive cleaners, solvents, or strong detergents. These can damage the coverstock and void your warranty.
*   **Hot Water:** As mentioned earlier, hot water can cause cracking or deformation.
*   **Abrasive Scrubbers:** Steel wool, scouring pads, and even rough sponges can scratch the surface.
*   **Towel Drying:** Towels can leave lint and streaks, and some materials can be abrasive.
*   **Prolonged Soaking:**  While soaking is beneficial, don’t leave the ball submerged for extended periods (over 30 minutes).

## Beyond Dawn: Additional Maintenance Tips

While Dawn is a great starting point, consider these additional maintenance tips for optimal ball performance.

*   **Ball Wipes:** Carry a microfiber towel and a bowling ball wipe to quickly remove surface oil between games.
*   **Resurfacing:** Over time, even with regular cleaning, the ball’s surface can become worn. Consider having your ball resurfaced by a professional to restore its original grip.
*   **Proper Storage:** Store your bowling ball in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. A bowling ball bag is ideal for protection.



## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can I use other dish soaps besides Dawn?**

A: While some other dish soaps *might* work, Dawn is consistently recommended by bowling professionals due to its grease-cutting ability and gentle formula. Other soaps may contain additives that can leave a residue or damage the ball’s surface.

**Q: How long does it take for a bowling ball to dry completely?**

A:  Allow at least 24 hours for a bowling ball to air dry completely.  Ensure it’s in a well-ventilated area.  Don’t rush the drying process, as any remaining moisture can lead to internal damage.

**Q: Will cleaning my bowling ball remove its hook potential?**

A: No, cleaning actually *restores* hook potential by removing oil that’s preventing the ball from gripping the lane.

**Q: Is it okay to use a bowling ball cleaner specifically designed for reactive resin balls?**

A: Yes, using a dedicated bowling ball cleaner is a great option, especially if you bowl frequently. Just be sure to choose a cleaner specifically formulated for your ball’s coverstock.
