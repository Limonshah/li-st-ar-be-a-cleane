## How to Clean a Wetsuit: A Complete Guide

Ever wondered how to keep your wetsuit fresh and functioning like new? A wetsuit is a significant investment, and proper cleaning isn’t just about hygiene; it’s about extending its lifespan and ensuring optimal performance. This article will walk you through everything you need to know about cleaning your wetsuit, from a quick rinse after each use to a more thorough cleaning schedule. We’ll cover the best practices, recommended products, and storage tips to keep your gear in top condition.

**Takeaway:**

*   Rinse your wetsuit with fresh water after *every* use.
*   Use a wetsuit-specific cleaner regularly to remove salt, chlorine, and organic matter.
*   Dry your wetsuit properly, away from direct sunlight and heat.
*   Store your wetsuit correctly to prevent damage and maintain its shape.

**Quick Answer:** To clean a wetsuit, rinse it thoroughly with fresh water after each use, then periodically wash it with a wetsuit-specific cleaner. Hang it to dry in a shaded, well-ventilated area, avoiding direct sunlight or heat. Proper cleaning extends the life of your wetsuit and keeps it hygienic.

## Why Cleaning Your Wetsuit Matters

Let's face it, wetsuits get exposed to a lot. Saltwater, chlorine, sand, sunscreen, and even bodily fluids all contribute to the breakdown of the neoprene material. Ignoring these contaminants can lead to stiffness, odor, and ultimately, a shorter lifespan for your suit. Regular cleaning removes these damaging elements, preserving the neoprene’s flexibility and preventing bacterial growth. Think of it like this: a clean wetsuit is a happy wetsuit, and a happy wetsuit keeps *you* comfortable in the water.

## The Immediate Rinse: After Every Use

The most important step in wetsuit care is a thorough rinse with fresh water after *every* single use. Don’t skip this! This simple act removes the bulk of the salt, chlorine, and debris that can cause damage. Focus on rinsing the inside of the suit, as this is where most of the contaminants accumulate. A quick soak in a tub or using a hose works well.

## Deep Cleaning Your Wetsuit: A Step-by-Step Guide

While rinsing is crucial, a deeper clean is necessary every 4-6 uses, or after particularly harsh conditions. Here’s how to do it:

1.  **Prepare Your Solution:** Use a wetsuit-specific cleaner. Avoid harsh detergents, bleach, or fabric softeners, as these can damage the neoprene.
2.  **Soak the Suit:** Fill a tub or large container with cool, fresh water and add the recommended amount of wetsuit cleaner. Submerge the wetsuit and gently agitate it to ensure the cleaner reaches all areas.
3.  **Gentle Scrubbing:** Use a soft sponge or brush to gently scrub areas prone to buildup, like the neck, wrists, and ankles. Avoid abrasive scrubbing, which can damage the neoprene.
4.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse the wetsuit multiple times with fresh water until all traces of the cleaner are gone. Residual cleaner can cause irritation.
5.  **Inspect for Damage:** While rinsing, take the opportunity to inspect your wetsuit for any tears, rips, or other damage. Addressing these issues promptly will prevent them from worsening.

## Drying Your Wetsuit Properly

Drying is just as important as cleaning. Improper drying can lead to mildew, odor, and neoprene degradation. Here’s what to do:

*   **Avoid Direct Sunlight:** UV rays break down neoprene. Always dry your wetsuit in the shade.
*   **Avoid Direct Heat:** Don’t use a dryer, radiator, or direct sunlight. Heat can cause the neoprene to become brittle and lose its flexibility.
*   **Hang Inside Out:** This allows the interior to dry more effectively, preventing bacterial growth.
*   **Use a Wide Hanger:** A standard hanger can create pressure points and stretch the shoulders. Use a wide, wetsuit-specific hanger or lay the suit flat.
*   **Ensure Good Ventilation:** A well-ventilated area will speed up the drying process.

## Storage: Protecting Your Investment

Proper storage is key to maintaining your wetsuit’s condition when it’s not in use. Here’s how to store it correctly:

*   **Completely Dry:** Ensure the wetsuit is completely dry before storing it.
*   **Hang Loosely:** Use a wide hanger or fold the wetsuit loosely to avoid creases.
*   **Cool, Dark Place:** Store the wetsuit in a cool, dark, and dry place away from direct sunlight and heat.
*   **Avoid Compression:** Don’t store the wetsuit compressed under heavy objects, as this can damage the neoprene.
*   **Consider a Wetsuit Bag:** A wetsuit bag provides protection from dust, sunlight, and other environmental factors.

## Dealing with Stubborn Odors

Even with regular cleaning, wetsuits can sometimes develop unpleasant odors. Here are a few tips for tackling stubborn smells:

*   **Baking Soda Soak:** Add a cup of baking soda to a tub of cool water and soak the wetsuit for several hours. Baking soda is a natural deodorizer.
*   **Vinegar Rinse:** Dilute white vinegar with water (1:1 ratio) and rinse the wetsuit thoroughly. Vinegar helps neutralize odors.
*   **Wetsuit-Specific Deodorizer:** Several products are specifically designed to eliminate odors from wetsuits.
*   **Air it Out:** After any odor-removing treatment, ensure the wetsuit is thoroughly dried and aired out.
