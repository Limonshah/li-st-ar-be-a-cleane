## Sparkling Clean: How to Clean Your Shower With Baking Soda

Is your shower looking a little less than inviting? Soap scum, mildew, and hard water stains can quickly make your shower a cleaning challenge. But don't reach for harsh chemicals just yet! You can achieve a beautifully clean shower using a simple, affordable, and eco-friendly solution: baking soda. This article will guide you through everything you need to know about how to clean your shower with baking soda, leaving it fresh and sparkling. We’ll cover everything from tackling tough stains to preventing future buildup.

**Takeaway:**

*   Baking soda is a gentle abrasive that effectively removes grime and soap scum.
*   Combining baking soda with vinegar creates a powerful cleaning fizz.
*   Regular cleaning with baking soda prevents buildup and keeps your shower looking its best.

**Quick Answer:** To clean your shower with baking soda, make a paste with baking soda and water, apply it to surfaces, let it sit for 15-20 minutes, scrub, and rinse thoroughly. For tougher stains, combine baking soda with vinegar for a fizzing action.

## Why Baking Soda is Your Shower’s New Best Friend

Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, is a fantastic natural cleaner. It’s a mild abrasive, meaning it can gently scrub away dirt and grime without scratching surfaces. It’s also alkaline, which helps to dissolve acidic dirt like soap scum and hard water stains. Plus, it’s non-toxic, making it a safe choice for your family and the environment. You likely already have some in your pantry, making it a convenient and cost-effective cleaning solution.  It’s a versatile cleaner, and you can even use it to [clean pots with baking soda](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-pots-with-baking-soda) after tackling the shower!

## Creating the Perfect Baking Soda Shower Cleaning Paste

The foundation of most baking soda shower cleaning methods is a simple paste. This paste allows the baking soda to cling to surfaces and work its magic. To make it, you’ll need just two ingredients: baking soda and water. Start with about ½ cup of baking soda and slowly add water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing until you achieve a paste-like consistency. You want it thick enough to stick to the shower walls but spreadable enough to cover the area easily.  For extra cleaning power, consider adding a few drops of your favorite essential oil, like tea tree or eucalyptus, for a fresh scent and added antibacterial properties.

## Tackling Soap Scum and Grime with Baking Soda

Soap scum is the bane of many shower-goers’ existence. Luckily, baking soda is up to the challenge. Apply the baking soda paste liberally to areas affected by soap scum, such as shower walls, doors, and the base of the shower. Let the paste sit for at least 15-20 minutes to allow the baking soda to break down the grime. Then, using a sponge, scrub brush, or even an old toothbrush for tight corners, scrub the areas thoroughly. Rinse well with warm water, and you’ll be amazed at the difference! If you're dealing with a particularly stubborn buildup, you might need to repeat the process.

## The Power of Baking Soda and Vinegar: A Fizzing Clean

For a truly powerful cleaning boost, combine baking soda with vinegar. This creates a fizzing action that helps to loosen and lift dirt and grime. *Important Note: Never mix baking soda and vinegar in a closed container, as the reaction creates gas that can cause pressure to build up.* Instead, sprinkle baking soda directly onto the shower surfaces, then spray with vinegar. Let the mixture fizz for 5-10 minutes, then scrub and rinse. This combination is particularly effective for tackling mildew and hard water stains.

### Cleaning Showerheads with Baking Soda

A clogged showerhead can ruin your shower experience. Baking soda can help! Remove the showerhead (if possible) and soak it in a solution of baking soda and warm water overnight. For showerheads that can’t be removed, fill a plastic bag with the solution, secure it around the showerhead with a rubber band, and let it soak for several hours.  After soaking, scrub away any remaining residue with a brush and rinse thoroughly.

## Don't Forget the Grout!

Grout lines are notorious for collecting dirt and mildew. Baking soda is a great way to brighten and clean them. Make a paste of baking soda and water, and apply it to the grout lines. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then scrub with an old toothbrush or grout brush. Rinse thoroughly with water. For particularly stubborn stains, you can add a little bit of hydrogen peroxide to the paste.  Keeping your grout clean will significantly improve the overall appearance of your shower.

## Preventing Future Buildup: Regular Maintenance

The best way to keep your shower clean is to prevent buildup in the first place. After each shower, quickly spray the walls and door with a vinegar and water solution (equal parts). This helps to prevent soap scum from forming.  Also, wipe down the shower walls and door with a squeegee after each use to remove excess water.  Regularly cleaning with baking soda – even just a quick scrub once a week – will keep your shower looking its best and prevent the need for more intensive cleaning later on.
