## Why Do My Rothys Smell?

Have you noticed an unpleasant odor coming from your beloved Rothy’s? It’s a common issue, and you’re not alone! Rothy’s, made from recycled plastic bottles, are fantastic shoes, but that material can sometimes trap moisture and bacteria, leading to unwanted smells. This is especially true if you wear them without socks or during warmer weather. Don't worry, though; getting rid of the smell is usually quite simple. This article will guide you through several effective methods to keep your Rothy’s smelling fresh and clean.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning is key to preventing odor buildup.
*   Air drying is crucial after each wear.
*   Baking soda and vinegar are effective natural deodorizers.
*   Washing machine cycles should be gentle and cool.

**Quick Answer:** To clean the smell out of Rothys, first air them out thoroughly. Then, sprinkle baking soda inside, let it sit overnight, and vacuum it out. For a deeper clean, machine wash on a gentle cycle with cold water and mild detergent, then air dry.

## Understanding the Source of the Odor in Rothys

Before diving into cleaning methods, it’s helpful to understand *why* Rothys develop odors. The knit construction, while comfortable and stylish, isn’t as breathable as some other materials. This means sweat and moisture can get trapped inside.  Bacteria thrive in these damp environments, and that’s what causes the smell.  Wearing Rothys without socks increases this issue, as your feet sweat directly onto the material.  Addressing the root cause – moisture and bacteria – is the key to eliminating the odor.

## Simple Daily Maintenance to Prevent Rothys Smell

Preventing odor is much easier than removing it! A little daily maintenance can go a long way. After each wear, take a few minutes to air out your Rothys. Remove the insoles (if applicable) and allow both the shoes and insoles to dry completely.  Don't toss them directly into a shoe bag or closet while they're still damp. Consider using a shoe dryer or placing them in a well-ventilated area.  This simple step significantly reduces the chance of bacteria growth.  For extra protection, you can also alternate wearing different pairs of Rothys to give each pair a chance to fully dry between uses.

## Baking Soda: Your Natural Rothys Deodorizer

Baking soda is a fantastic, natural odor absorber. It’s gentle, inexpensive, and readily available. To use it on your Rothys, start by removing any loose dirt or debris. Then, generously sprinkle baking soda inside each shoe, ensuring you get it into all the nooks and crannies. Let the baking soda sit overnight – or even for 24 hours for particularly stubborn odors.  The baking soda will absorb the smells.  Finally, thoroughly vacuum out the baking soda using a hose attachment. This method is great for a quick refresh between washes.

## Machine Washing Your Rothys: A Step-by-Step Guide

Rothy’s are designed to be machine washable, which makes cleaning them relatively easy. However, it’s important to follow the correct procedure to avoid damaging the shoes. First, place your Rothys inside a mesh laundry bag to protect them during the wash cycle. Use a gentle cycle with cold water and a mild detergent. Avoid using bleach or fabric softener, as these can damage the material. Once the wash cycle is complete, *never* put your Rothys in the dryer.  Always air dry them completely, away from direct sunlight or heat.  Direct heat can warp the shape of your shoes.

### Dealing with Stubborn Odors During Washing

Sometimes, a single wash isn’t enough to eliminate strong odors. If the smell persists, try adding a cup of white vinegar to the wash cycle. Vinegar is a natural disinfectant and odor neutralizer.  It won’t harm your Rothys, but it will help break down the bacteria causing the smell.  You can also pre-soak your Rothys in a solution of cold water and vinegar for about 30 minutes before washing them.  This gives the vinegar extra time to work its magic.

## Vinegar Spray: A Quick Refreshing Solution

For a quick odor refresh between washes, you can create a vinegar spray. Mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Lightly mist the inside of your Rothys with the solution, being careful not to saturate the material. Allow the shoes to air dry completely. The vinegar smell will dissipate as it dries, leaving your Rothys smelling much fresher. This is a great option for daily maintenance or after a particularly sweaty workout.

## Addressing Insoles and Potential Odor Traps

Don’t forget about the insoles! If your Rothys have removable insoles, take them out and wash them separately. You can hand wash them with mild soap and water, or place them in the washing machine with your shoes (inside a laundry bag, of course).  Pay attention to any areas where the insole meets the shoe, as these can be odor traps.  Ensure these areas are thoroughly cleaned and dried.  If your Rothys don’t have removable insoles, you can still clean them with a damp cloth and a mild cleaning solution.



## FAQ About Cleaning Rothys Smell

**Q: How often should I clean my Rothys?**

A: It depends on how often you wear them and the conditions you wear them in. Generally, a quick baking soda refresh every week or two, and a machine wash every month or two, is sufficient. If you notice a strong odor, clean them more frequently.

**Q: Can I use bleach on my Rothys?**

A: No, absolutely not! Bleach can damage the recycled plastic material and discolor your shoes. Always use a mild detergent.

**Q: What if the smell persists after washing?**

**Q: Can I use a shoe deodorizer spray on my Rothys?**

A: Yes, but choose a spray specifically designed for shoes and test it on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t cause discoloration.

**Q: How long does it take for Rothys to dry completely?**

A: Air drying can take anywhere from 12 to 24 hours, depending on the humidity and ventilation. Ensure they are completely dry before wearing them to prevent odor buildup.
