## Getting Your Above Ground Pool Sparkling: A Guide to Algae Removal

Is your once-blue above ground pool now looking green and murky? Don't worry, algae is a common problem, but thankfully, it's one you can tackle yourself! This article will walk you through a step-by-step process for cleaning algae from your above ground pool, restoring it to a clean and inviting space. We’ll cover everything from identifying the type of algae to preventative measures to keep it from returning. Let's get started and reclaim your summer fun!

**Takeaway:**

*   Brush the pool walls and floor thoroughly.
*   Clean or backwash your pool filter.
*   Shock the pool with a high dose of chlorine.
*   Run the filter continuously until the water is clear.
*   Test and balance your pool water chemistry.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean an above ground pool with algae, brush the walls and floor, clean the filter, shock the water with chlorine, and run the filter continuously until clear. Regularly testing and balancing your water chemistry is key to prevention.

## 1. Identifying the Algae in Your Pool

Before you start cleaning, it’s helpful to know what type of algae you’re dealing with. Different types require slightly different approaches. The most common types include green algae, yellow (mustard) algae, and black algae. 

*   **Green Algae:** This is the most common, appearing as a slimy green coating on pool surfaces. It thrives in sunlight and unbalanced water.
*   **Yellow (Mustard) Algae:** This appears as a yellowish-brown dust that can be brushed away easily. It’s often found in shaded areas.
*   **Black Algae:** The most stubborn type, black algae forms hard, dark spots that are deeply rooted in the pool surface. It requires aggressive treatment.

Knowing the type of algae will help you choose the right cleaning methods and chemicals. If you're unsure, a local pool supply store can help with identification.

## 2. Initial Pool Cleaning: Brushing and Vacuuming

The first step in removing algae is physical removal. Grab your pool brush and thoroughly scrub the walls and floor of the pool. This dislodges the algae, making it easier for the chemicals to work. Pay special attention to corners and areas with visible growth. 

After brushing, you’ll need to vacuum the pool. If you have a manual vacuum, connect it to your skimmer and slowly vacuum the entire pool floor. If you have an automatic pool cleaner, let it do the work for you.  Removing the debris is crucial before shocking the pool.  Consider using a leaf rake to remove any large debris before vacuuming to prevent clogging your filter.

## 3. Cleaning and Backwashing Your Pool Filter

A dirty filter significantly reduces the effectiveness of your cleaning efforts. Before shocking the pool, clean or backwash your filter. 

*   **Sand Filters:** Backwash the filter until the water runs clear. This reverses the water flow, flushing out trapped debris.
*   **Cartridge Filters:** Remove the cartridge and rinse it thoroughly with a garden hose. For stubborn debris, use a filter cleaning solution.
*   **Diatomaceous Earth (DE) Filters:** Backwash the filter and then add more DE powder as needed.

A clean filter ensures proper water circulation and maximizes the impact of the chlorine shock.  Regular filter maintenance is essential for a healthy pool. You can learn more about how often to clean your pool filter [here](https://beacleaner.com/how-often-should-you-clean-the-pool-filter).

## 4. Shocking Your Above Ground Pool

Shocking the pool involves adding a high dose of chlorine to kill the algae. This is the most important step in the cleaning process. The amount of shock you need depends on the severity of the algae bloom and the size of your pool. Always follow the instructions on the shock product label.

*   **Superchlorination:** This involves adding a significantly higher dose of chlorine than usual.
*   **Non-Chlorine Shock:** This uses potassium monopersulfate to oxidize organic contaminants without raising chlorine levels.

After adding the shock, run the pump continuously for 24-48 hours to circulate the water and ensure the chlorine reaches all areas of the pool. Avoid swimming until the chlorine levels return to a safe range (1-3 ppm).

## 5. Balancing Your Pool Water Chemistry

Shocking the pool kills the algae, but balancing your water chemistry prevents it from returning. Test your water using a test kit or strips and adjust the following levels:

*   **pH:** 7.2-7.8
*   **Alkalinity:** 80-120 ppm
*   **Calcium Hardness:** 200-400 ppm
*   **Cyanuric Acid (Stabilizer):** 30-50 ppm

Properly balanced water creates an environment that inhibits algae growth. Maintaining these levels consistently is key to a clear and healthy pool.

## 6. Preventing Future Algae Blooms

Once your pool is clean, take steps to prevent algae from returning. 

*   **Regularly Test and Balance Water:** Test your water at least once a week and adjust the levels as needed.
*   **Maintain Proper Chlorine Levels:** Keep your chlorine levels within the recommended range (1-3 ppm).
*   **Run the Filter Regularly:** Run your filter for at least 8-12 hours per day.
*   **Brush the Pool Weekly:** Regular brushing prevents algae from taking hold.
*   **Use an Algaecide:** Consider using an algaecide as a preventative measure.

Consistent maintenance is the best defense against algae.  You might also consider a phosphate remover, as phosphates are a food source for algae.  If you have a screen enclosure, keeping it clean can also help reduce algae growth [here](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-algae-from-pool-screen-enclosure).

## 7. Dealing with Stubborn Black Algae

Black algae is notoriously difficult to remove. If you're dealing with this type, you may need to take extra steps.

*   **Aggressive Brushing:** Use a stainless steel brush to scrub the black algae spots vigorously.
*   **Localized Shock Treatment:** Apply a concentrated chlorine tablet directly to the algae spot.
*   **Algae-Specific Algaecide:** Use an algaecide specifically designed for black algae.
*   **Repeat Treatment:** You may need to repeat the treatment several times to completely eradicate the algae.



## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How long does it take to clear algae from a pool?**
A: It typically takes 24-72 hours to clear algae from a pool after shocking and balancing the water. The exact time depends on the severity of the bloom and the effectiveness of your cleaning efforts.

**Q: Can I swim in the pool after shocking it?**
A: No, you should not swim in the pool until the chlorine levels return to a safe range (1-3 ppm). Test the water before allowing anyone to swim.

**Q: What causes algae to grow in pools?**
A: Algae growth is caused by a combination of factors, including sunlight, warm water, poor circulation, and unbalanced water chemistry.

**Q: Is it possible to clean a pool without draining it?**
A: Yes, in most cases, you can clean an algae-infested pool without draining it. Shocking, brushing, and filtering are usually sufficient.
