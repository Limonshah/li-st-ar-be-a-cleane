## How To Clean Airless Sprayer Oil: A Step-by-Step Guide

Have you just finished a painting project using oil-based paints or stains with your airless sprayer? Proper cleaning is crucial to ensure your sprayer continues to function efficiently and lasts for years. Ignoring this step can lead to clogs, reduced performance, and ultimately, a costly replacement. This guide will walk you through exactly how to clean airless sprayer oil, keeping your equipment in top shape. We’ll cover everything from initial flushing to detailed component cleaning.

**Takeaway:**

*   Flush the system with mineral spirits or cleaning solvent immediately after use.
*   Disassemble key components like the tip, guard, and intake filter.
*   Thoroughly clean each part with appropriate solvents.
*   Lubricate the piston rod and seals to prevent drying and cracking.
*   Proper storage is key to maintaining your airless sprayer.

Cleaning your airless sprayer after using oil-based products is essential for its longevity. It’s a straightforward process, but requires attention to detail. Let’s dive into the steps!

### Why Cleaning After Oil-Based Products is Different

Using oil-based paints, stains, or varnishes requires a different cleaning approach than water-based products. Water simply won’t dissolve oil, so you need a solvent to break it down. Mineral spirits are the most common choice, but specific cleaning solutions designed for airless sprayers are also available. Using the wrong cleaning agent can leave residue, causing future problems. This residue can harden and clog the sprayer, impacting its performance and potentially damaging internal parts.

### Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Before you begin, gather everything you’ll need to make the process smooth and efficient. Having all your supplies ready will save you time and frustration. Here’s a checklist:

*   Mineral spirits or airless sprayer cleaning solution
*   Two buckets – one for cleaning, one for rinsing
*   Adjustable wrench
*   Screwdrivers (various sizes)
*   Cleaning brushes (small nylon brushes work well)
*   Rags or paper towels
*   Protective gloves and eyewear
*   Lubricating oil (specifically for airless sprayers)

### Flushing the Sprayer System

The first step is to flush the system with your chosen solvent. This removes the bulk of the oil-based material from the hoses, pump, and spray tip. Start by disconnecting the intake tube from the paint container. Then, place the intake tube into a bucket filled with mineral spirits.  Next, spray the solvent through the system until it runs clear. This process might take several minutes, so be patient.  

### Disassembling Key Components for Deep Cleaning

Once the system is flushed, it’s time to disassemble key components for a more thorough cleaning. This includes the spray tip, guard, and intake filter.  Carefully remove the spray tip and guard using an adjustable wrench.  Then, remove the intake filter from the sprayer.  These parts accumulate a significant amount of residue, so detailed cleaning is vital.

### Cleaning the Spray Tip and Guard

The spray tip and guard are prone to clogging, so they require special attention. Soak these parts in mineral spirits for at least 30 minutes to loosen the dried paint. After soaking, use a small nylon brush to scrub away any remaining residue. Pay close attention to the tiny orifice of the spray tip, as even a small blockage can affect spray pattern. Ensure the tip is completely clear before reassembling.  If you're dealing with stubborn paint, you can use a specialized tip cleaning tool.

### Cleaning the Intake Filter and Strainer

The intake filter and strainer prevent debris from entering the pump. Remove any visible particles and soak them in mineral spirits. Use a brush to scrub away any remaining residue. A clogged intake filter can significantly reduce sprayer performance, so keeping it clean is essential.  Regularly inspecting and cleaning this component will prevent future issues.  If the filter is damaged, replace it immediately.

### Cleaning the Sprayer Housing and Pump

While the internal pump components generally don’t require disassembly for routine cleaning, the exterior of the sprayer housing should be wiped down with a solvent-dampened rag. This removes any splatters or spills. Avoid getting solvent into the motor or electrical components.  If you notice any oil buildup around the pump, carefully clean it with a brush and solvent.

### Lubricating the Sprayer for Storage

After cleaning, lubricating the piston rod and seals is crucial. This prevents them from drying out and cracking during storage. Apply a thin coat of lubricating oil specifically designed for airless sprayers.  Work the piston rod back and forth to distribute the lubricant evenly.  Proper lubrication ensures smooth operation and extends the life of your sprayer.  Don't use general-purpose oils, as they may not provide adequate protection.

### Proper Storage to Prevent Future Issues

Storing your airless sprayer correctly is just as important as cleaning it. After lubricating, store the sprayer in a clean, dry place. Protect it from extreme temperatures and direct sunlight.  Consider storing the sprayer with a small amount of solvent in the system to prevent the seals from drying out.  Regular maintenance and proper storage will keep your airless sprayer in optimal condition for years to come.
