## Keeping Your Glow Going: How To Clean A Self Tanning Mitt

Have you ever wondered how to properly care for your self tanning mitt? A clean mitt is crucial for a flawless, streak-free tan and prevents bacteria buildup. It’s easy to overlook, but cleaning your self tanning mitt after *every* use is a game-changer. This article will guide you through everything you need to know about cleaning your self tanning mitt, extending its life, and ensuring a perfect sunless tan every time. We’ll cover the best cleaning methods, drying tips, and how to know when it’s time to replace your mitt.

**Takeaway:**

*   Clean your self tanning mitt after *each* use.
*   Use mild soap and cool water.
*   Air dry completely to prevent bacteria growth.
*   Replace your mitt every 2-3 months, or sooner if it shows signs of wear.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean a self tanning mitt, gently hand wash it with mild soap and cool water, rinse thoroughly, and air dry completely. Avoid harsh detergents or machine washing, as these can damage the mitt’s texture. Regular cleaning prevents bacteria buildup and ensures a flawless tan application.

## Why Cleaning Your Self Tanning Mitt Matters

Let's face it, nobody wants a patchy, uneven tan. A dirty self tanning mitt can lead to streaks and an overall less-than-ideal result. Beyond aesthetics, a dirty mitt harbors bacteria from your skin, old tan residue, and potentially even mold. This can cause skin irritation or even breakouts. Think of it like a makeup brush – you wouldn’t reuse one without cleaning it, right?  Regular cleaning extends the life of your mitt, saving you money in the long run. 

## The Best Way to Clean Your Self Tanning Mitt

Hand washing is the gold standard for cleaning your self tanning mitt. It’s gentle and effective, preserving the mitt’s delicate texture. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Rinse Immediately:** After each use, immediately rinse the mitt under cool water to remove excess tanning product. Don't let the product dry onto the mitt!
2.  **Mild Soap Time:** Add a small amount of mild soap – think baby shampoo or a gentle body wash – to the cool water. Avoid harsh detergents or anything with strong fragrances.
3.  **Gentle Scrubbing:** Gently massage the mitt to loosen any remaining product. Focus on areas that accumulate more tan, like the palms and fingers.
4.  **Thorough Rinse:** Rinse the mitt thoroughly under cool water until all soap residue is gone. Any remaining soap can affect your next tan application.
5.  **Press, Don't Wring:** Gently press the mitt to remove excess water. *Never* wring it out, as this can damage the fibers.

## Drying Your Self Tanning Mitt Properly

Proper drying is just as important as cleaning. A damp mitt is a breeding ground for bacteria. Here’s how to dry your mitt effectively:

*   **Air Dry Only:** Always air dry your self tanning mitt. Avoid using a dryer, as the heat can melt or damage the material.
*   **Lay Flat or Hang:** Lay the mitt flat on a clean towel or hang it in a well-ventilated area. Ensure it’s fully exposed to air.
*   **Avoid Direct Sunlight:** While air drying is essential, avoid direct sunlight, which can fade the mitt’s color and potentially degrade the material.
*   **Ensure Complete Dryness:** Before storing, make absolutely sure the mitt is completely dry. This prevents mold and bacteria growth.

## Dealing with Stubborn Tan Residue

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, tan residue can linger. Don’t worry, there are a few tricks to tackle stubborn stains. For particularly tough spots, consider these options:

*   **Baking Soda Paste:** Create a paste of baking soda and water. Gently apply it to the stained area, let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then rinse thoroughly.
*   **Micellar Water:** Micellar water, commonly used for makeup removal, can also effectively lift tan residue. Apply it to a cotton pad and gently wipe the affected area.
*   **Gentle Exfoliating Scrub:** A very gentle exfoliating scrub can help loosen stubborn tan. Use it sparingly and with a light touch to avoid damaging the mitt.

## When to Replace Your Self Tanning Mitt

Even with diligent cleaning, self tanning mitts don’t last forever. Over time, the fibers break down, and the mitt loses its effectiveness. Here are some signs it’s time for a replacement:

*   **Visible Wear and Tear:** If the mitt is ripped, torn, or showing significant signs of wear, it’s time to replace it.
*   **Persistent Odor:** If the mitt retains an unpleasant odor even after cleaning, it’s likely harboring bacteria and should be discarded.
*   **Changes in Texture:** If the mitt feels rough or uneven, it won’t provide a smooth, even application.
*   **Frequency of Use:** As a general rule, replace your self tanning mitt every 2-3 months, or sooner if you use it frequently.  Regular replacement ensures optimal results and hygiene.

## Extending the Life of Your Mitt: Pro Tips

Want to get the most out of your self tanning mitt? Here are a few extra tips:

*   **Dedicated Mitt:** Use a dedicated mitt *only* for self tanning. Don’t use it for other products like sunscreen or moisturizer.
*   **Apply Lotion First:** Before applying self tanner, apply a light moisturizer to your skin. This creates a barrier and helps prevent the tan from clinging to dry patches.
*   **Store Properly:** Store your clean, dry mitt in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.
*   **Consider Multiple Mitts:** If you tan frequently, consider having multiple mitts on hand so you always have a clean one ready to go.
