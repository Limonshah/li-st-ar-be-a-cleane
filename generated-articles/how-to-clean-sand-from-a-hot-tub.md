## Getting Your Hot Tub Back to Sparkling: How To Clean Sand From A Hot Tub

Finding sand in your hot tub is a frustrating experience. It’s likely happened after a fun day at the beach or a playful splash with kids. But don't worry, removing sand isn’t as difficult as you might think! This article will guide you through the process of cleaning sand from your hot tub, ensuring a clean and relaxing soak. We’ll cover everything from initial filtration to a thorough cleaning process, so you can get back to enjoying your spa.

**Takeaway:**

*   Drain some water to see the sand settle.
*   Clean or replace your hot tub filter.
*   Vacuum the sand from the bottom of the tub.
*   Rinse the hot tub thoroughly before refilling.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean sand from a hot tub, first, run the filter for an extended period. Then, partially drain the tub to allow sand to settle, vacuum it out, and thoroughly clean or replace the filter. Finally, rinse and refill the tub for a sparkling clean experience.

## 1. Understanding How Sand Gets Into Your Hot Tub

Let's face it, sand finds its way into everything! Usually, sand enters your hot tub through swimsuits, towels, or directly from people tracking it in. It’s a common issue, especially during warmer months when beach trips and outdoor play are frequent. The fine particles can quickly sink to the bottom or get caught in your filtration system. Knowing how it gets in helps you prevent future occurrences, like having a designated rinse station near the hot tub.

Sand is abrasive and can damage your hot tub’s surfaces and components over time. It can scratch the acrylic shell and, more importantly, clog your pump and filter. Regular maintenance and prompt removal are key to protecting your investment.

## 2. The First Line of Defense: Your Hot Tub Filter

Your hot tub filter is your best friend when it comes to removing debris, including sand. The filter traps particles as water circulates through the system. However, a filter can only handle so much. When sand accumulates, it reduces the filter’s efficiency and can even cause damage. 

Therefore, the first step in cleaning sand from your hot tub is to check and clean your filter. If it’s heavily saturated with sand, consider replacing it. A clean filter ensures optimal water circulation and prevents sand from recirculating. For detailed instructions on filter maintenance, check out this guide on [how to clean hot tub filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hot-tub-filter).

### Filter Cleaning Frequency

*   **Regular Use:** Rinse your filter every 2-4 weeks.
*   **Heavy Use/Sand Incident:** Clean or replace the filter immediately after noticing sand.
*   **Deep Clean:** Perform a thorough filter cleaning with a filter cleaning solution every 3-6 months.

## 3. Draining and Settling: Letting Gravity Do the Work

After checking the filter, it’s time to address the sand that has settled at the bottom of your hot tub. Partially draining the hot tub allows the sand to collect in a concentrated area, making it easier to remove. Don’t drain the entire tub, as this can be more time-consuming and require more water to refill.

Drain enough water so that the sand is visible and accessible. Let the remaining water sit for about 30 minutes to allow any suspended sand particles to settle. This step is crucial for efficient removal and prevents stirring up more sand during the cleaning process.

## 4. Vacuuming Out the Sand: Manual Removal

Now for the hands-on part! Use a hot tub vacuum to remove the settled sand from the bottom of the tub. A hot tub vacuum is specifically designed for this purpose and won’t damage the surface. If you don’t have a dedicated hot tub vacuum, a shop vac with a hose attachment can work in a pinch, but be careful not to scratch the acrylic.

Slowly and methodically vacuum the entire bottom surface of the hot tub. Pay attention to corners and crevices where sand tends to accumulate. Once you’ve removed the visible sand, it’s time to rinse the tub thoroughly.

## 5. Thoroughly Rinsing Your Hot Tub Shell

After vacuuming, rinse the entire hot tub shell to remove any remaining sand particles. Use a garden hose with a gentle spray nozzle. Avoid using high-pressure sprays, as they can damage the surface. 

Focus on areas where sand might have clung to the shell, such as around jets and seats. A clean shell ensures that no sand remains to contaminate the fresh water when you refill the tub. You might also want to consider cleaning the [hot tub shell](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hot-tub-shell) with a mild soap designed for hot tubs during this step.

## 6. Inspecting and Cleaning Jets and Plumbing

Sand can also make its way into your hot tub’s jets and plumbing. This can cause blockages and reduce water flow. Inspect each jet for any visible sand buildup. You can use a small brush or toothpick to gently remove any sand particles.

For a more thorough cleaning of the plumbing, you might consider using a hot tub plumbing cleaner. These cleaners help to flush out debris and prevent buildup. If you suspect significant sand accumulation in the plumbing, consult a professional for assistance. Maintaining clean [hot tub pipes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hot-tub-pipes) is essential for long-term hot tub health.

## 7. Refilling and Balancing Your Hot Tub Water

Once you’ve thoroughly cleaned the hot tub, it’s time to refill it with fresh water. Before adding chemicals, ensure the water is balanced. Test the water’s pH, alkalinity, and sanitizer levels. Adjust as needed to maintain optimal water chemistry.

Proper water balance not only ensures a comfortable soaking experience but also protects your hot tub’s components from corrosion and scaling. Remember to shock the water after refilling to eliminate any remaining bacteria or contaminants.

## FAQ: Common Questions About Sand in Hot Tubs

**Q: How can I prevent sand from getting into my hot tub?**

A: Encourage bathers to rinse off before entering the hot tub. Use a designated rinse station with a hose or shower. Also, avoid bringing sandy items like beach toys or towels directly into the hot tub area.

**Q: What if I can’t get all the sand out of the filter?**

A: If the filter is heavily saturated with sand and cleaning doesn’t restore its efficiency, it’s best to replace it. A clogged filter can damage your pump and reduce water circulation.

**Q: Can sand damage my hot tub’s pump?**

A: Yes, sand is abrasive and can wear down the pump’s impeller and seals. This can lead to leaks and costly repairs. Prompt sand removal is crucial for protecting your pump.

**Q: Is it okay to use a regular vacuum cleaner to remove sand from my hot tub?**

A: While a shop vac can work, it’s not ideal. The hard plastic attachments can scratch the hot tub’s surface. A dedicated hot tub vacuum is the safest option.



## Conclusion: Enjoy a Sand-Free Soak!

Dealing with sand in your hot tub can be a bit of a hassle, but with the right approach, you can quickly restore it to its sparkling clean state. Remember to prioritize filter maintenance, drain and settle the water, vacuum thoroughly, and rinse the shell. By following these steps, you’ll be back to enjoying a relaxing and sand-free soak in no time. Don’t let a little sand ruin your hot tub experience – take action and keep your spa clean and inviting!
