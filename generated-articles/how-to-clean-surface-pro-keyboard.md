## Keeping Your Surface Pro Keyboard Clean & Functional

Is your Surface Pro keyboard looking a little worse for wear? Dust, crumbs, and oils from your fingers can quickly accumulate, impacting both its appearance and functionality. A clean keyboard isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about ensuring a smooth and responsive typing experience. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to clean your Surface Pro keyboard effectively, from quick daily maintenance to more thorough cleaning routines. We’ll cover the best tools, techniques, and precautions to keep your device in top condition.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly dust your keyboard with a microfiber cloth.
*   Use compressed air to remove debris from between the keys.
*   Gently wipe the keys with a slightly damp (not wet!) cloth.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive cleaners.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean your Surface Pro keyboard, start by powering it off. Use compressed air to dislodge debris, then gently wipe the keys with a microfiber cloth dampened with isopropyl alcohol. Avoid spraying liquids directly onto the keyboard and always ensure it's dry before powering it back on.

## 1. Daily Keyboard Maintenance: Preventing Build-Up

Let's face it: keyboards attract all sorts of gunk. A little preventative maintenance goes a long way in keeping your Surface Pro keyboard clean. Make it a habit to quickly wipe down the keys at the end of each day with a soft, dry microfiber cloth. This removes surface dust and oils before they have a chance to build up.  Consider this your first line of defense against a grimy keyboard.  You can also invest in a [keyboard cover](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-keyboard-cover) for added protection against spills and debris.

## 2. Removing Loose Debris with Compressed Air

Sometimes, a simple wipe isn’t enough. Crumbs, dust bunnies, and other small particles can get lodged between the keys. This is where compressed air comes in handy. Hold the can upright and use short bursts of air to dislodge debris. Angle the nozzle to get under the keys, but avoid holding the can too close, as this can damage the keyboard.  For stubborn particles, try tilting the Surface Pro at different angles while using the compressed air.  If you find compressed air isn't enough, you might consider looking into how to [clean a mechanical keyboard](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mechanical-keyboard) for more advanced techniques.

## 3. Deep Cleaning Your Surface Pro Keyboard

For a more thorough clean, you’ll need a few supplies. Gather a microfiber cloth, isopropyl alcohol (70% concentration is ideal), and cotton swabs. First, power off your Surface Pro completely.  Never attempt to clean a powered-on device.  Next, lightly dampen the microfiber cloth with isopropyl alcohol – *do not* saturate it. Gently wipe each key individually, paying attention to areas with visible grime.  

### 3.1 Cleaning Around the Keys

Use a cotton swab dipped in isopropyl alcohol to clean around the edges of the keys. This helps remove dirt and grime that accumulates in those hard-to-reach areas. Be careful not to let any liquid drip into the keyboard.  Remember, a little moisture goes a long way.  If you're dealing with a particularly sticky mess, you might find tips on how to [clean a greasy keyboard](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-greasy-keyboard) helpful.

## 4. Dealing with Sticky Keys and Stubborn Stains

Sticky keys are frustrating, but often fixable. If a key is sticking, try gently prying it up with a plastic spudger or a similar tool (avoid metal, as it can scratch the surface). Clean underneath the keycap with a cotton swab dipped in isopropyl alcohol.  Allow it to dry completely before reattaching the keycap. For stubborn stains, you may need to repeat the cleaning process several times.  Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the keyboard’s finish.

## 5. Important Don'ts: What to Avoid When Cleaning

Cleaning your Surface Pro keyboard isn’t just about *what* you do, but also *what you don’t* do.  Here’s a list of things to avoid:

*   **Don't spray liquids directly onto the keyboard.** This can cause serious damage.
*   **Don't use harsh chemicals like bleach or ammonia.** These can discolor the keys and damage the surface.
*   **Don't use abrasive cleaners or scouring pads.** These can scratch the keyboard.
*   **Don't disassemble the keyboard unless you are experienced.** You could damage it beyond repair.
*   **Don't use excessive force when cleaning.** Gentle pressure is all that’s needed.

## 6. Maintaining a Clean Keyboard Long-Term

Once you’ve cleaned your Surface Pro keyboard, it’s important to maintain it.  Regular dusting and wiping will prevent build-up and keep your keyboard looking its best.  Consider establishing a cleaning schedule – for example, a quick wipe-down daily and a more thorough cleaning weekly or bi-weekly.  Also, be mindful of what you eat and drink near your Surface Pro.  Spills happen, but being careful can prevent a lot of cleaning headaches.
