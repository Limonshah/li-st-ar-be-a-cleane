## Sparkling Clean: How to Clean Stainless Steel Pans With Baking Soda

Is your stainless steel cookware looking a little dull, or worse, covered in burnt-on food? Don't worry, you don't need harsh chemicals to restore its shine. This guide will show you exactly [how to clean stainless steel pans with baking soda](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-stainless-steel-pans-with-baking-soda), a readily available, eco-friendly solution. We’ll cover everything from tackling everyday messes to dealing with stubborn, baked-on residue.  This article will give you the knowledge to keep your pans looking their best, saving you time and money.

**Takeaway:**

*   Baking soda is a gentle abrasive perfect for stainless steel.
*   A baking soda paste effectively removes burnt food and stains.
*   Vinegar can boost baking soda’s cleaning power for tough messes.
*   Regular cleaning prevents buildup and makes future cleaning easier.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean stainless steel pans with baking soda, make a paste of baking soda and water, apply it to the pan, let it sit for 15-20 minutes, then scrub gently with a non-abrasive sponge. Rinse thoroughly and dry.



## Why Baking Soda Works Wonders on Stainless Steel

Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, is a fantastic natural cleaner. It’s mildly abrasive, meaning it can gently scrub away grime without scratching your stainless steel.  It also neutralizes odors and helps to dissolve grease and food particles. Unlike harsh chemical cleaners, baking soda is non-toxic and safe for use around food.  This makes it an ideal choice for cleaning cookware you use every day. 

## Creating the Perfect Baking Soda Cleaning Paste

The foundation of cleaning stainless steel with baking soda is creating the right paste.  You’ll need baking soda and water – that’s it! Start with about 3 tablespoons of baking soda and slowly add water, one teaspoon at a time, mixing until you achieve a paste-like consistency.  The paste should be thick enough to cling to the pan’s surface but spreadable enough to cover the area you’re cleaning. For particularly stubborn messes, you can add a few drops of dish soap to the paste for extra cleaning power.

## Tackling Everyday Food Residue

For everyday cleaning, after cooking, let your stainless steel pan cool slightly. Then, apply the baking soda paste to the interior surface.  Let it sit for about 10-15 minutes to allow the baking soda to loosen the food particles.  Using a soft sponge or cloth, gently scrub the pan in a circular motion. Avoid using steel wool or abrasive scrubbers, as these can scratch the stainless steel. Rinse thoroughly with warm water and dry with a clean towel.  Regular cleaning like this prevents food from building up and becoming harder to remove later.

## Removing Stubborn, Burnt-On Food

Burnt-on food can be a real challenge, but baking soda can still help!  Start by covering the burnt areas with a generous layer of baking soda paste.  Next, add about a cup of water to the pan and bring it to a simmer on the stovetop for 10-15 minutes.  This helps to loosen the burnt food. After simmering, let the pan cool slightly, then scrub gently with a non-abrasive sponge. If the food is still stuck, repeat the process or try adding a splash of white vinegar to the paste – the combination creates a fizzing action that can help lift the residue.  For extremely stubborn cases, consider letting the paste sit overnight before scrubbing.

## Boosting Cleaning Power with Vinegar

Vinegar and baking soda are a dynamic cleaning duo.  When combined, they create a fizzing reaction that helps to lift dirt and grime.  After applying the baking soda paste to your pan, drizzle a small amount of white vinegar over it.  Let the mixture fizz for a few minutes, then scrub gently with a sponge.  The vinegar helps to break down grease and food particles, making them easier to remove.  Remember to rinse thoroughly after using vinegar, as it can leave a lingering odor.  If you're dealing with hard water stains, vinegar is especially effective.

## Polishing Stainless Steel for a Brilliant Shine

Once your pan is clean, you can polish it to restore its shine.  After rinsing and drying, sprinkle a small amount of baking soda onto a clean, damp cloth.  Gently rub the cloth over the exterior of the pan in the direction of the grain.  This will help to remove any remaining water spots or fingerprints.  Alternatively, you can use a stainless steel polish specifically designed for cookware.  Regular polishing will keep your pans looking their best and prevent them from becoming dull over time.
