**What is Borax and How Does it Clean?**

Borax, also known as sodium borate, is a naturally occurring mineral salt. It’s a powerful cleaner because it acts as a natural disinfectant, deodorizer, and stain remover. It boosts the effectiveness of your detergent, softens water, and helps to emulsify oils and grease, making them easier to wash away. It’s a fantastic all-around cleaning agent, and a little goes a long way.

## Borax for Laundry: A Stain-Fighting Superstar

Let’s start with laundry, where Borax truly shines. Adding Borax to your washing machine can significantly improve your laundry results. It helps brighten whites, remove stains, and deodorize clothes, leaving them fresh and clean. 

*   **Boosting Detergent:** Add ½ cup of Borax to your regular laundry detergent for an extra cleaning boost.
*   **Whitening Whites:** For dingy whites, soak them in a solution of hot water and ½ cup of Borax before washing.
*   **Removing Stains:** Create a paste of Borax and water, apply it to the stain, let it sit for 30 minutes, and then wash as usual. This works wonders on grass, mud, and even some food stains.
*   **Deodorizing Laundry:** Add ½ cup of Borax to the wash cycle to eliminate odors from sweaty gym clothes or musty towels.

## Borax and Pest Control: A Natural Deterrent

Borax isn’t just a cleaner; it can also help deter pests. While not a complete pest control solution, it can be used as a natural deterrent for ants and cockroaches.

*   **Ant Control:** Sprinkle a line of Borax along ant trails to disrupt their scent and deter them from entering your home.
