## Understanding Your Kenmore 70 Series Washer

Kenmore 70 Series washers are known for their reliability and efficiency. However, like all appliances, they require regular maintenance to function at their best. Over time, detergent residue, fabric softener buildup, and hard water minerals can accumulate inside the washer. This buildup can lead to unpleasant odors, reduced cleaning performance, and even damage to the machine. Understanding the different parts of your washer – the drum, dispenser, hoses, and drain pump – will help you target your cleaning efforts effectively.  Regular cleaning is a simple way to protect your investment.

## Cleaning the Washer Drum: Removing Residue & Odors

The washer drum is where the magic happens, but it’s also where most residue accumulates.  You can effectively clean the drum using a washer cleaner or a simple DIY solution. Here’s how:

1.  **Choose Your Cleaner:** You can use a commercially available washer cleaner, following the product instructions. Alternatively, use 1 cup of white vinegar and ¼ cup of baking soda.
2.  **Run a Cleaning Cycle:**  Most Kenmore 70 Series washers have a dedicated cleaning cycle. If yours does, select it. If not, run a hot water cycle with the chosen cleaner.
3.  **Wipe Down the Drum:** After the cycle completes, use a clean cloth to wipe down the inside of the drum, removing any remaining residue.  For stubborn buildup, consider a second cleaning cycle.

## Deep Cleaning the Dispenser Drawers

The dispenser drawers for detergent, fabric softener, and bleach are prone to buildup.  Residue can harden and clog the dispenser, affecting its performance.  Here’s how to clean them:

1.  **Remove the Drawers:** Most Kenmore 70 Series dispensers are removable. Consult your owner’s manual for specific instructions.
2.  **Soak in Warm Water:** Soak the drawers in warm, soapy water for about 30 minutes to loosen any hardened residue.
3.  **Scrub and Rinse:** Use a soft brush or sponge to scrub away any remaining buildup. Rinse thoroughly with clean water.
4.  **Dry and Reinstall:**  Allow the drawers to dry completely before reinstalling them into the washer.  Keeping the dispenser clean ensures proper detergent distribution.

## Inspecting and Cleaning the Drain Pump Filter

The drain pump filter catches lint, hair, and small objects that can clog the drain pump. A clogged drain pump can prevent your washer from draining properly.  Here’s how to inspect and clean it:

1.  **Locate the Filter:** The drain pump filter is usually located behind a small access panel on the front of the washer, near the bottom.
2.  **Prepare for Water:** Place a shallow pan or towel under the access panel to catch any water that may spill out.
3.  **Remove and Clean:** Carefully remove the filter and clean it thoroughly, removing any lint, hair, or debris.
4.  **Reinstall:** Reinstall the filter securely.  Regularly checking the filter prevents drainage issues.

## Cleaning the Exterior of Your Kenmore 70 Series Washer

Don’t forget the outside of your washer! Dust, spills, and fingerprints can accumulate on the exterior surfaces.  Here’s how to clean them:

1.  **Wipe Down with a Damp Cloth:** Use a damp cloth with a mild detergent to wipe down the exterior surfaces of the washer.
2.  **Dry with a Clean Cloth:** Dry the surfaces with a clean, dry cloth to prevent water spots.
3.  **Polish (Optional):** For a polished look, you can use a stainless steel cleaner on stainless steel surfaces.  A clean exterior keeps your laundry room looking its best.

## Addressing Mold and Mildew Concerns

Mold and mildew can grow in washers, especially in humid environments.  Here’s how to prevent and address mold and mildew:

1.  **Leave the Door Ajar:** After each wash cycle, leave the washer door slightly ajar to allow air to circulate and prevent moisture buildup.
2.  **Run a Hot Water Cycle Regularly:** Run a hot water cycle with a washer cleaner or vinegar/baking soda solution at least once a month to kill any mold or mildew spores.
3.  **Inspect the Gasket:** If you have a front-load washer, regularly inspect the rubber gasket around the door for mold and mildew. Clean it with a bleach solution (1 part bleach to 10 parts water) if necessary.
