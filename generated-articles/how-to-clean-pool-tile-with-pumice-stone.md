## Sparkling Clean: How To Clean Pool Tile With Pumice Stone

Is your pool tile looking less than inviting? A white, hazy buildup can quickly make your beautiful pool area appear neglected. Fortunately, restoring your pool tile to its former glory doesn’t require harsh chemicals or expensive equipment. This article will show you how to effectively clean pool tile with a pumice stone, a surprisingly powerful and eco-friendly solution. We’ll cover everything from choosing the right pumice stone to the proper technique for a sparkling clean finish.

**Takeaway:**

*   Use a pumice stone specifically designed for pool cleaning.
*   Always wet both the tile and the pumice stone before use.
*   Apply gentle pressure and rub in a circular motion.
*   Rinse the area thoroughly after cleaning.

**Quick Answer:** To clean pool tile with a pumice stone, wet both the tile and the stone, then gently rub the stone along the tile surface in a circular motion to remove calcium buildup and stains. Rinse thoroughly with water afterward.

## Why Choose a Pumice Stone for Pool Tile?

Many pool owners struggle with calcium buildup, algae stains, and general grime on their tile. Traditional cleaning methods often involve harsh chemicals that can be harmful to your pool’s ecosystem and your health. A pumice stone offers a natural and effective alternative. It’s a lightweight, abrasive volcanic rock that gently scrubs away deposits without damaging the tile surface. Plus, it’s an affordable and readily available cleaning tool. 

Using a pumice stone is a great way to avoid stronger chemicals. You can also explore other natural cleaning solutions like vinegar for certain types of stains.

## Selecting the Right Pumice Stone

Not all pumice stones are created equal. For cleaning pool tile, you need a specific type designed for this purpose. Avoid using pumice stones intended for foot care, as these may contain additives or be too abrasive. Look for a pumice stone specifically labeled for pool tile cleaning. These are typically denser and have a more consistent abrasive texture. 

Consider the shape and size of the stone. A smaller, contoured stone is ideal for reaching tight corners and detailed tile patterns. Larger, flat stones are better for covering larger surface areas quickly. You can find these stones at most pool supply stores or online retailers.

## Preparing to Clean Your Pool Tile

Before you start scrubbing, a little preparation goes a long way. First, lower the water level in your pool slightly, exposing the tile you intend to clean. This makes the process easier and prevents water from constantly washing away the loosened debris. Next, thoroughly wet both the pool tile and the pumice stone with water. This lubrication is crucial – it prevents scratching and helps the stone glide smoothly across the surface. 

It’s also a good idea to brush off any loose debris, like leaves or dirt, with a pool brush before using the pumice stone. This will prevent you from simply spreading the dirt around while you clean.

## The Cleaning Process: Step-by-Step

Now for the main event! Hold the pumice stone firmly and apply gentle pressure to the tile. Rub the stone in a circular motion, focusing on areas with visible buildup. Avoid pressing too hard, as excessive force can potentially scratch the tile, especially glass tile. Let the abrasive action of the stone do the work. 

Work in small sections, rinsing the area frequently with water to remove loosened debris. You’ll immediately see the calcium buildup and stains disappearing. Continue this process until all the affected tile is clean. Remember to keep both the tile and the pumice stone wet throughout the cleaning process.

## Dealing with Stubborn Stains and Buildup

Sometimes, even a pumice stone needs a little help. For particularly stubborn stains, you can try pre-treating the area with a pool tile cleaner specifically designed to dissolve calcium buildup. Follow the product instructions carefully. After the pre-treatment has had time to work, use the pumice stone as described above. 

If you're dealing with rust stains, a specialized rust remover may be necessary. Always test any cleaning solution in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t damage the tile.

## Maintaining Your Clean Pool Tile

Cleaning your pool tile with a pumice stone is a great start, but regular maintenance is key to preventing buildup from returning. Brush your pool tile weekly with a pool brush to remove loose debris and prevent algae growth. Regularly test and balance your pool water chemistry, as proper pH and calcium levels can help minimize scale formation. 

Consider using a phosphate remover to reduce the nutrients that algae need to thrive. By staying on top of these maintenance tasks, you can keep your pool tile sparkling clean and avoid the need for frequent, intensive cleaning sessions.
