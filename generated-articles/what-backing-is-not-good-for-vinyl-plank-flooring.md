## Is Your Underlayment Hurting Your Vinyl Plank Floors?

Have you just purchased beautiful vinyl plank flooring and are wondering what kind of backing to use? Choosing the right underlayment is crucial for the longevity and performance of your new floor. But just as important is knowing *what not to use*. Using the wrong backing can lead to issues like voided warranties, uneven surfaces, and even damage to your vinyl planks. This article will detail what backing materials are not good for vinyl plank flooring, helping you make an informed decision and protect your investment. We’ll cover common mistakes and provide guidance for a successful installation.

**Takeaway:**

*   Avoid felt, rubber, and standard foam underlayments not specifically designed for vinyl plank.
*   Ensure any underlayment used is approved by the vinyl plank manufacturer to maintain warranty coverage.
*   Prioritize underlayments with moisture barriers, especially on concrete subfloors.
*   Always check the flatness of your subfloor before installation.



**What Backing Should You *Never* Use Under Vinyl Plank Flooring?**

Simply put, not all underlayments are created equal. While it might seem like any padding would work, certain materials can actively harm your vinyl plank flooring. Using the wrong backing can cause problems down the line, so it’s best to know what to avoid from the start. 

## 1. Felt Underlayment: A Surprisingly Bad Choice

Felt underlayment is often used for hardwood floors, but it’s a definite no-go for vinyl plank. Felt absorbs moisture, and vinyl plank, while water-resistant, isn’t waterproof. Trapped moisture can lead to mold and mildew growth underneath the flooring, potentially causing warping or damage. Additionally, felt can compress over time, creating an uneven surface that can affect the stability of your planks.

## 2. Standard Rubber Underlayment: Issues with Stability

While rubber underlayment offers cushioning, it’s generally not recommended for vinyl plank. Many standard rubber underlayments contain plasticizers that can react with the vinyl, causing discoloration or staining. More importantly, rubber can be too soft and flexible, leading to instability and potential damage to the locking mechanisms of the planks. This is especially true for thicker vinyl planks.  A stable subfloor is key, and rubber often compromises that.

## 3. Thick, Low-Density Foam Underlayment: The Problem with Compression

You might think more cushioning is always better, but that’s not the case with vinyl plank. Thick, low-density foam underlayments can compress easily under the weight of furniture and foot traffic. This compression creates an uneven surface, potentially causing the planks to separate or become damaged. Look for high-density foam specifically designed for vinyl plank, or consider alternatives like cork.

### Understanding Density and its Impact

The density of the underlayment is a critical factor. Higher density means the material is more resistant to compression and will provide better support for your vinyl planks. Look for underlayments with a density of at least 3 lbs per cubic foot. This ensures long-term stability and prevents the formation of dips and valleys in your floor.

## 4. Asphalt-Based Underlayment: A Definite No-No

Asphalt-based underlayment is an older type of flooring underlayment that’s rarely used anymore, and for good reason. It’s brittle, prone to cracking, and releases harmful VOCs (volatile organic compounds). It’s also completely incompatible with vinyl plank flooring, as it doesn’t provide the necessary cushioning or moisture protection. Avoid this material at all costs.

## 5. Newspaper or Cardboard: Seriously?

This might seem obvious, but it’s worth mentioning. Using newspaper or cardboard as underlayment is a terrible idea. These materials offer no cushioning, no moisture protection, and will quickly decompose, creating a breeding ground for mold and mildew. Always use a proper underlayment designed for flooring applications.



## 6. Existing Underlayment: Don't Assume It's Suitable

Just because there’s underlayment already installed doesn’t mean it’s suitable for your new vinyl plank flooring. Inspect the existing underlayment carefully. Is it felt, rubber, or old foam? If so, it should be removed before installing your new floor.  A clean slate is essential for a successful installation.

### The Importance of a Level Subfloor

Before even considering underlayment, ensure your subfloor is level. Vinyl plank flooring requires a flat, smooth surface for proper installation. Any imperfections in the subfloor will telegraph through the planks, creating an uneven and unsightly floor. Use a self-leveling compound to address any significant dips or bumps.

## What *Should* You Use for Vinyl Plank Underlayment?

Now that you know what to avoid, let’s talk about what *is* good for vinyl plank flooring. The best options include:

*   **Vinyl-Specific Underlayment:** These are specifically designed to work with vinyl plank, offering the right density, moisture protection, and compatibility.
*   **Cork Underlayment:** Cork is a natural, sustainable option that provides excellent cushioning and sound absorption.
*   **High-Density Foam Underlayment:** Look for foam with a density of at least 3 lbs per cubic foot and a moisture barrier.



## FAQ About Vinyl Plank Flooring Backing

**Q: Can I install vinyl plank flooring directly over concrete?**

A: Yes, but you *must* use an underlayment with a moisture barrier. Concrete is porous and can release moisture, which can damage your flooring. A proper underlayment will prevent moisture from reaching the planks.

**Q: Does my vinyl plank flooring *need* underlayment?**

A: Some vinyl plank flooring comes with pre-attached underlayment. If yours doesn’t, using an underlayment is highly recommended for added cushioning, sound absorption, and moisture protection.

**Q: What if my warranty requires a specific underlayment?**

A: Always check your warranty requirements before installing any underlayment. Using a non-approved underlayment can void your warranty.

**Q: How do I know if my subfloor is level enough?**

A: Use a long level (at least 6 feet) to check for dips and bumps. If there are any significant variations, you’ll need to level the subfloor before installing your flooring.



## Choosing the Right Backing: Protect Your Investment

Selecting the right underlayment for your vinyl plank flooring is a critical step in the installation process. By avoiding felt, rubber, and unsuitable foam, and opting for vinyl-specific or cork underlayment, you can ensure a beautiful, durable, and long-lasting floor. Remember to always check your manufacturer’s recommendations and prioritize a level subfloor for optimal results.
