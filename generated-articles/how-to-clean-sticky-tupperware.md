## How To Clean Sticky Tupperware: A Simple Guide

Is your Tupperware looking less than fresh? Do you find yourself struggling with a sticky residue that just won’t come off? You’re not alone! Sticky Tupperware is a common kitchen problem, but thankfully, it’s usually a very solvable one. This article will walk you through several effective methods to clean sticky Tupperware and get it back to being a useful part of your kitchen. We’ll cover everything from simple soap and water to more intensive cleaning solutions. Let’s dive in and get those containers sparkling!

**Takeaway:**

*   Use warm, soapy water as a first step.
*   Baking soda paste is excellent for stubborn residue.
*   Vinegar can help dissolve hard water stains and stickiness.
*   Consider a bleach solution for sanitizing (use with caution).

**Quick Answer:**

To clean sticky Tupperware, start with warm, soapy water and a good scrub. For tougher residue, create a paste of baking soda and water, apply it to the sticky areas, let it sit, and then scrub clean. Rinse thoroughly and allow to air dry.

## Understanding Why Tupperware Gets Sticky

Have you ever wondered *why* your Tupperware becomes sticky in the first place? It’s usually due to leftover food particles, especially those containing oils or sugars. These residues cling to the plastic, creating a tacky surface. Over time, this can worsen, especially if the containers aren’t cleaned immediately after use. Hard water can also contribute to the problem, leaving mineral deposits that feel sticky. Knowing the cause helps you choose the right cleaning method.

## The Power of Soap and Water: Your First Line of Defense

Often, the simplest solution is the best. Start by washing your sticky Tupperware with warm water and dish soap. Use a non-abrasive sponge or cloth to scrub the affected areas. Don’t be afraid to let the soapy water soak in for a few minutes to loosen the residue. This is especially helpful for recent spills or light stickiness. Rinse thoroughly with clean water and allow the containers to air dry completely. Sometimes, this is all you need to restore your Tupperware to its original condition.

## Baking Soda: A Natural Sticky Residue Remover

Baking soda is a fantastic natural cleaner and deodorizer. It’s mildly abrasive, making it perfect for scrubbing away sticky residue without damaging the plastic. To use baking soda, create a paste by mixing equal parts baking soda and water. Apply the paste to the sticky areas of your Tupperware and let it sit for 15-20 minutes. Then, scrub gently with a sponge or cloth. Rinse thoroughly with water. Baking soda is a great alternative to harsh chemicals and is safe for food containers.

## Vinegar to the Rescue: Dissolving Stubborn Stickiness

White vinegar is another powerful natural cleaner. Its acidity helps dissolve hard water stains and sticky residue. You can use vinegar in a couple of ways. First, you can fill the Tupperware container with a solution of equal parts vinegar and water. Let it soak for several hours, or even overnight, before scrubbing and rinsing. Alternatively, you can spray vinegar directly onto the sticky areas, let it sit for a few minutes, and then scrub.

## Bleach Solution: For Sanitizing and Tough Cases (Use with Caution!)

For particularly stubborn stickiness or if you want to sanitize your Tupperware, you can use a diluted bleach solution. *However, use this method with extreme caution!* Mix 1 tablespoon of bleach with 1 gallon of water. Pour the solution into the Tupperware container, let it sit for 5-10 minutes, and then rinse *thoroughly* with water. Ensure all traces of bleach are removed before using the container for food storage. Bleach can be harsh, so always wear gloves and work in a well-ventilated area.

## Preventing Sticky Tupperware in the Future

Cleaning sticky Tupperware is important, but preventing it is even better! Here are a few tips to keep your containers clean and fresh:

*   **Wash immediately:** Don’t let food sit in your Tupperware for extended periods. Wash containers as soon as possible after use.
*   **Pre-soak:** If you can’t wash immediately, fill the container with warm water to prevent food from drying and sticking.
*   **Avoid oily foods:** Oily foods are more likely to leave a sticky residue. Consider using glass containers for these types of foods.
*   **Proper storage:** Store Tupperware with the lids slightly ajar to allow for air circulation and prevent moisture buildup.
*   **Regular cleaning:** Even if your Tupperware doesn’t *look* dirty, give it a regular cleaning to prevent buildup. You can also check out [how to clean mold from Tupperware](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-from-tupperware) to ensure your containers are safe and hygienic.
