## Keeping Your Brew Fresh: How To Clean Your Braun Coffee Maker With The Clean Button

Is your Braun coffee maker not brewing as flavorful a cup as it used to? Mineral buildup and coffee oils can significantly impact the taste of your coffee and the lifespan of your machine. Fortunately, many Braun coffee makers come equipped with a handy “Clean” button designed to simplify the descaling process. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to effectively clean your Braun coffee maker, ensuring years of delicious coffee. We’ll cover the entire process, from preparation to rinsing, so you can enjoy a consistently great brew.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning prevents mineral buildup.
*   Use a descaling solution or white vinegar.
*   The “Clean” button automates the process.
*   Rinse thoroughly after descaling.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean a Braun coffee maker with a clean button, fill the water reservoir with a descaling solution or a mixture of equal parts white vinegar and water. Press and hold the “Clean” button until the cleaning cycle begins, and allow it to run completely. Finally, rinse the reservoir and brew a few cycles with fresh water.

## Understanding Why Cleaning Your Braun Coffee Maker Matters

Regularly cleaning your Braun coffee maker isn’t just about taste; it’s about maintaining the appliance’s functionality. Over time, minerals from your water supply accumulate inside the machine, forming scale. This scale can clog the internal components, reducing brewing efficiency and potentially causing damage. A clean coffee maker brews better coffee and lasts longer. Ignoring this maintenance can lead to costly repairs or even the need for a replacement.

## Gathering Your Supplies for a Sparkling Clean

Before you begin, ensure you have everything you need for a smooth cleaning process. You’ll need either a commercial descaling solution specifically designed for coffee makers, or white vinegar. White vinegar is a cost-effective and readily available alternative. You’ll also need fresh water for rinsing. Finally, have a clean cloth handy to wipe down the exterior of the coffee maker.  Consider using a [stainless steel cleaner](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-stainless-steel-stovetop-espresso-maker) if your Braun coffee maker has stainless steel accents.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Using the “Clean” Button

This is the core of the cleaning process, and thankfully, Braun makes it quite straightforward. First, prepare your cleaning solution. If using white vinegar, mix equal parts white vinegar and water. Pour the solution into the water reservoir, ensuring you don’t exceed the maximum fill line. Next, ensure the carafe is empty and in place. Now, press and *hold* the “Clean” button. The button usually requires a few seconds of holding to initiate the cleaning cycle. The coffee maker will then begin the descaling process automatically.

## What to Expect During the Cleaning Cycle

The cleaning cycle will typically involve a series of brewing and pausing phases. This allows the descaling solution to circulate through the entire system, dissolving mineral buildup. You might notice steam and some gurgling sounds – this is normal. Do not interrupt the cleaning cycle once it has started.  Allow the cycle to complete fully, even if it takes longer than a regular brewing cycle.  If you're unsure about the process, you can always refer to your Braun coffee maker’s user manual for specific instructions.

## Rinsing Thoroughly: Removing Any Lingering Taste

Once the cleaning cycle is complete, it’s crucial to rinse the coffee maker thoroughly. Empty the carafe and the water reservoir. Fill the reservoir with fresh, clean water. Run a full brewing cycle with just water. Repeat this process at least two to three times to ensure all traces of the cleaning solution are removed. This prevents any lingering vinegar or descaling solution taste from affecting your next cup of coffee.

## Maintaining Your Braun Coffee Maker: Preventative Measures

Cleaning with the “Clean” button is essential, but preventative measures can reduce the frequency needed. Using filtered water in your coffee maker significantly reduces mineral buildup. Regularly wiping down the exterior of the machine with a damp cloth prevents coffee stains and keeps it looking its best.  Also, consider cleaning the removable parts, like the filter basket, after each use.  If you have a more complex coffee system, like a [Cuisinart coffee maker with a grinder](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-cuisinart-coffee-maker-with-a-grinder), you may need additional cleaning steps.
