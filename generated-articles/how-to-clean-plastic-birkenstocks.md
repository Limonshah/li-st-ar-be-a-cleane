## Maintain Your Style: How To Clean Plastic Birkenstocks

Owning plastic Birkenstocks is a smart choice for many. They offer comfort and style, just like their classic counterparts. However, these durable sandals still need regular cleaning. Keeping them fresh ensures they look good and last a long time. I often find myself reaching for mine, especially on rainy days or during beach trips.

Knowing how to clean plastic Birkenstocks correctly is important. The material, often EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate), makes them waterproof and easy to care for. This guide will show you simple steps to wash away dirt and stains. You can keep your favorite sandals looking new with minimal effort. We will cover basic cleaning, stain removal, odor solutions, and long-term care.

### Takeaway

Keeping your plastic Birkenstocks clean is easy.
*   Rinse off loose dirt with water.
*   Use mild soap and a soft brush for deeper cleaning.
*   Address stubborn stains and odors promptly.
*   Air dry completely, away from direct heat.
*   Store them properly to keep their shape and appearance.

To clean plastic Birkenstocks, rinse them under cool water to remove loose dirt. Apply a small amount of mild soap directly to the surface. Use a soft brush or cloth to gently scrub all areas, including the footbed. Rinse thoroughly until no soap remains, then let them air dry away from direct sunlight or heat.

## Understanding Your Plastic Birkenstocks: The EVA Advantage

Plastic Birkenstocks are popular for good reason. They are very different from the traditional cork and leather models. The main material for these sandals is EVA. This material is a type of foam that offers many benefits. I appreciate how lightweight these shoes feel on my feet.

EVA makes these Birkenstocks incredibly versatile. They are waterproof, unlike their classic cousins. This means you can wear them to the beach or pool without worry. They also dry quickly. Their durable nature makes them perfect for active lifestyles.

The closed-cell foam structure of EVA prevents water absorption. This quality helps keep your feet dry. It also makes the sandals resistant to common issues like mold and mildew, though they are not immune. Their flexibility also adds to comfort, allowing them to adapt to your foot's shape over time. This unique composition simplifies the cleaning process significantly.

## Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Cleaning your plastic Birkenstocks does not require special tools. You likely have everything you need at home already. Using the right supplies ensures you clean them safely and effectively. I always make sure I have these items ready before I start.

First, you need a source of water. A sink, a hose, or a bucket of water works well. Next, find a mild soap. Dish soap, hand soap, or a gentle laundry detergent are all good choices. Harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners can damage the EVA material. Avoid these.

You will also need something to scrub with. A soft-bristled brush is perfect for this. An old toothbrush works well for small areas or seams. A soft cloth or sponge can also do the job. Finally, have a clean towel ready for drying. These simple items are all you need for a fresh pair of plastic Birkenstocks.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Basic Cleaning for Everyday Dirt

Cleaning your plastic Birkenstocks regularly keeps them looking great. This simple process helps remove everyday dirt and grime. I usually give mine a quick wash after a muddy walk or a day at the park. It prevents dirt from building up and becoming harder to remove.

Start by rinsing your Birkenstocks under cool, running water. A garden hose works well if you are outside. If you are indoors, use a sink or showerhead. This step removes loose dirt and debris. Make sure to get all the sand and small particles off the surface.

Next, apply a small amount of mild soap to a soft brush or cloth. Gently scrub the entire surface of the sandal. Pay attention to the footbed where dirt and sweat can accumulate. The textured footbed of plastic Birkenstocks can trap more grime. For cleaning the footbed and general interior, you can apply similar principles as when you [clean the inside of Birkenstocks](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-inside-of-birkenstocks). Work the soap into a light lather. Continue scrubbing until the surface appears clean.

After scrubbing, rinse the sandals thoroughly under running water again. Make sure all soap residue is gone. Soap left on the material can attract more dirt over time. Shake off excess water. Then, use a clean towel to pat them dry. Allow them to air dry completely in a shaded, well-ventilated area. Avoid direct sunlight or heat sources. High heat can warp or damage the EVA material.

## Tackling Stubborn Stains on Your EVA Birkenstocks

Stubborn stains can appear on plastic Birkenstocks despite regular cleaning. Mud, scuffs, and food spills are common culprits. Removing these stains needs a bit more focus. I have dealt with countless stains on my own plastic sandals, from grass marks to coffee spills.

For most general stains, a baking soda paste works wonders. Mix a small amount of baking soda with water to create a thick paste. Apply this paste directly onto the stain. Let it sit for about 10-15 minutes. The baking soda helps lift the stain from the EVA material. This method is gentle yet effective for various marks.

After the paste sits, gently scrub the area with a soft brush. An old toothbrush is perfect for getting into the textured footbed. Rinse the sandal thoroughly under running water. Ensure all baking soda residue is gone. For more persistent marks or scuffs, a magic eraser can be surprisingly effective. Test it on a small, hidden area first to ensure it does not cause any discoloration. For comprehensive advice on removing various marks, you might find it helpful to learn [how to clean stains on plastic](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-stains-on-plastic) from different sources. Always rinse and air dry your Birkenstocks completely after stain treatment.

## Eliminating Mold and Odor from Plastic Birkenstocks

Plastic Birkenstocks are less prone to mold than other materials. However, if left damp or stored in humid conditions, mold and mildew can grow. They can also develop an unpleasant odor over time from sweat and bacteria. I have had to tackle this issue myself after leaving my sandals in a damp gym bag too long.

To combat mold, a simple vinegar solution is very effective. Mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Spray the solution generously over the affected areas. Let it sit for about 15-20 minutes. Vinegar is a natural disinfectant and mold killer. This method also helps neutralize odors. For specific guidance, you can refer to tips on [how to clean mold off plastic](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-off-plastic) surfaces.

After the solution has soaked, scrub the areas with a soft brush. Pay close attention to any visible mold spots. Rinse the Birkenstocks thoroughly with water to remove the vinegar solution and loosened mold. For stubborn mold, a diluted bleach solution (1 part bleach to 10 parts water) can be used, but use sparingly and rinse extremely well. Always ensure proper ventilation when using bleach.

To prevent future odor and mold, ensure your plastic Birkenstocks dry completely after each use. Store them in a well-ventilated area. You can sprinkle a little baking soda on the footbed overnight to absorb odors. Simply tap it out in the morning before wearing.

## Restoring the Shine: Advanced Care Tips for Plastic Birkenstocks

After cleaning, you might want to restore the fresh look of your plastic Birkenstocks. Over time, even EVA can lose some of its original luster. Giving them a little extra care can make them look almost new again. I like to keep my sandals looking their best, especially after a thorough cleaning.

One simple trick is to wipe them down with a damp cloth after they dry. This helps remove any remaining water spots or light film. For an added polish, you can use a very small amount of silicone-based protectant. Apply it to a cloth, then wipe the surface of the EVA. This can help restore a subtle sheen and offer a layer of protection. Ensure the product is safe for plastic materials. General tips for maintaining various plastic surfaces, such as those found when you [clean a plastic shower](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-plastic-shower), can also be applicable here for restoring gloss.

Avoid using oil-based products, as they can attract dirt. Also, keep your plastic Birkenstocks away from extreme heat. Leaving them in a hot car or direct strong sunlight for long periods can cause the EVA to warp or shrink. This heat damage is irreversible. Proper storage in a cool, shaded place helps maintain their shape and appearance. Regular cleaning combined with these advanced tips will ensure your plastic Birkenstocks stay looking great for many seasons.

## Regular Maintenance for Long-Lasting Plastic Birkenstocks

Consistent care helps your plastic Birkenstocks last longer. Small, regular actions prevent major cleaning tasks. I believe a little effort each day saves a lot of work later. This approach keeps my sandals in excellent condition.

After wearing your Birkenstocks, take a moment to wipe them down. A quick swipe with a damp cloth removes sweat and light dirt. This simple step prevents grime from building up on the footbed and straps. For quick drying, place them in an area with good air circulation. Avoid tossing them into a cluttered closet when they are still damp.

Store your plastic Birkenstocks properly when not in use. Keep them in a cool, dry place. Avoid direct sunlight or extreme temperatures. High heat can cause the EVA material to deform. If you store them for extended periods, consider placing them in a shoe bag to protect them from dust. Following these basic maintenance steps will extend the life and appearance of your plastic Birkenstocks, ensuring they remain a comfortable and stylish option for your feet.

## FAQ Section

### Can I machine wash my plastic Birkenstocks?
No, it is not recommended to machine wash plastic Birkenstocks. The high heat from a washing machine or dryer can warp the EVA material. Hand washing with mild soap and water is the safest and most effective method. This manual process helps preserve their shape and structural integrity.

### How often should I clean my plastic Birkenstocks?
The frequency depends on how often you wear them and what activities you do. For everyday wear, a quick rinse or wipe down after each use is good. A thorough cleaning with soap and water should happen every few weeks or whenever they look visibly dirty. Regular light cleaning prevents dirt buildup.

### What should I do if my plastic Birkenstocks get wet?
Plastic Birkenstocks are waterproof, so getting them wet is fine. Simply rinse them thoroughly with clean water to remove any mud or debris. Then, shake off excess water. Allow them to air dry completely in a well-ventilated area away from direct heat or sunlight. They dry quickly.

### Can I use harsh chemicals like bleach on my plastic Birkenstocks?
It is best to avoid harsh chemicals like undiluted bleach or abrasive cleaners. These can damage the EVA material, causing discoloration or breakdown. A diluted bleach solution can be used sparingly for tough mold, but always rinse thoroughly afterwards. Mild soap and water are generally sufficient for cleaning.

### How do I remove black scuff marks from my plastic Birkenstocks?
For black scuff marks, try gently rubbing the area with a pencil eraser first. If that does not work, a "magic eraser" sponge can be very effective. Lightly dampen the sponge and rub the mark in small circular motions. Always test on a less visible spot first to ensure it does not affect the color.

### Can I put my plastic Birkenstocks in the sun to dry them faster?
No, avoid putting your plastic Birkenstocks in direct sunlight or using a hairdryer to dry them. Intense heat can cause the EVA material to shrink, warp, or lose its shape. Always air dry them in a shaded, well-ventilated spot. Patience ensures they maintain their original fit and form.
