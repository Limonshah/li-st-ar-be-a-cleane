## Subaru Startex Cleaning: A Complete Guide

Is your Subaru’s interior starting to show its age? Subaru Startex fabric is known for its durability and water resistance, but it still requires regular cleaning to maintain its appearance. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to effectively clean your Subaru Startex, keeping it looking fresh and protecting your investment. We’ll cover everything from routine vacuuming to tackling stubborn stains.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular vacuuming prevents dirt buildup.
*   Mild soap and water are best for general cleaning.
*   Spot treat stains immediately for best results.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals that can damage the fabric.

**What is Subaru Startex and Why Does it Need Cleaning?**

Subaru Startex is a polyester-based fabric designed to be highly durable and resistant to stains, wear, and tear. It’s a fantastic material for active lifestyles, but it’s not entirely maintenance-free. Over time, dirt, dust, and spills can accumulate, leading to discoloration and a less-than-fresh interior. Regular cleaning is essential to preserve the fabric’s quality and keep your Subaru looking its best.

### Routine Cleaning: Vacuuming and Dusting

The first step in keeping your Subaru Startex clean is regular vacuuming. Aim to vacuum your seats and floor mats at least once a week, or more often if you frequently transport passengers or cargo. Use a brush attachment to gently loosen dirt and debris embedded in the fabric. Don't forget to get into the seams and crevices! This prevents dirt from becoming ground in and causing long-term staining.

### Mild Soap and Water: General Cleaning

For a more thorough cleaning, you can use a mild soap and water solution. Mix a small amount of gentle dish soap with lukewarm water. Dip a clean microfiber cloth into the solution, wring it out thoroughly, and gently wipe down the Startex surfaces. Avoid soaking the fabric, as excessive moisture can lead to mildew. After wiping, use a clean, damp cloth to rinse away any soap residue. [Learn more about general car upholstery cleaning here](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-startex-upholstery).

### Tackling Stains: Immediate Action is Key

Stains happen, but acting quickly can significantly improve your chances of removing them. Blot the stain immediately with a clean cloth, working from the outside in to prevent it from spreading. Avoid rubbing, as this can push the stain deeper into the fabric. Different types of stains require different approaches, which we’ll cover in the next section.

### Specific Stain Removal Techniques

Different stains require different cleaning methods. Here’s a breakdown of how to tackle some common culprits:

*   **Food and Drink Spills:** Use the mild soap and water solution described above. For stubborn stains, you can try a dedicated upholstery cleaner specifically designed for synthetic fabrics.
*   **Oil-Based Stains:** Sprinkle baking soda onto the stain to absorb the oil. Let it sit for 15-30 minutes, then vacuum it up. Repeat if necessary.
*   **Mud and Dirt:** Allow the mud to dry completely, then vacuum it up. If a stain remains, use the mild soap and water solution.
*   **Ink:** Dab the stain with rubbing alcohol on a clean cloth. Test in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t damage the fabric.

### Choosing the Right Cleaning Products

When cleaning Subaru Startex, it’s crucial to choose the right products. Avoid harsh chemicals, bleach, and abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the fabric and cause discoloration. Opt for pH-neutral cleaners specifically designed for synthetic upholstery. Always test any cleaning product in an inconspicuous area before applying it to the entire surface. You can also find specialized Subaru Startex cleaners available online or at auto detailing stores.

### Drying Your Subaru Startex

After cleaning, it’s important to dry your Subaru Startex thoroughly. Open the windows and doors to allow for good ventilation. You can also use a fan to speed up the drying process. Avoid direct sunlight, as this can cause fading. Ensure the fabric is completely dry before using your vehicle to prevent mildew growth.
