## Keeping Your Tile Looking New: How to Clean Sanded Grout

Is your tiled floor or shower looking a little dull? Often, the culprit isn’t the tile itself, but the sanded grout between them. Sanded grout, commonly used in floors and larger tile areas, is more porous and prone to staining than its epoxy counterpart. Don't worry, restoring your grout’s original color is achievable with the right techniques and a little elbow grease. This article will guide you through everything you need to know about how to clean sanded grout, from simple DIY solutions to tackling stubborn stains.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning prevents buildup.
*   Baking soda and vinegar are effective for light stains.
*   A grout brush is essential for scrubbing.
*   Sealing grout protects it from future damage.

**What is sanded grout and why does it get dirty?**

Sanded grout contains, you guessed it, sand! This addition makes it ideal for wider grout lines (typically 1/8 inch or more) because it reduces shrinkage during curing. However, the porous nature of sanded grout means it readily absorbs dirt, grime, and spills. This is especially true in high-traffic areas like kitchens and bathrooms. Over time, this absorption leads to discoloration and a generally dingy appearance.

## Understanding Sanded Grout: What Makes it Different?

Before diving into cleaning methods, it’s important to understand what makes sanded grout unique. Unlike epoxy grout, sanded grout isn’t waterproof and requires more maintenance. The sand particles create a textured surface, which can trap dirt and make it harder to clean. Knowing this helps you choose the right cleaning products and techniques.  You'll want to avoid harsh chemicals that could damage the grout or discolor it.  Regular cleaning is key to preventing deep-set stains and maintaining the appearance of your tile.

## DIY Cleaning Solutions for Sanded Grout

You don’t always need expensive cleaners to tackle dirty grout. Many effective solutions can be found right in your pantry! These DIY options are often gentler on your grout and the environment. 

### Baking Soda and Vinegar Paste

This classic combination is a powerhouse for cleaning. Mix baking soda with enough white vinegar to form a paste. Apply the paste to the grout lines, let it sit for 5-10 minutes, then scrub with a [grout brush](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bathroom-grout). Rinse thoroughly with water. The fizzing action helps lift dirt and grime.

### Hydrogen Peroxide and Baking Soda

For tougher stains, try a paste of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda. This mixture has mild bleaching properties, making it effective for brightening grout. Apply, let sit, scrub, and rinse, just like the vinegar paste.  Always test this mixture in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t discolor your grout.

## The Power of Scrubbing: Tools and Techniques

No matter which cleaning solution you choose, effective scrubbing is crucial. A good [grout brush](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-grout-in-shower) is your best friend here. Look for a brush with stiff bristles designed specifically for grout lines. 

*   **Manual Scrubbing:** For smaller areas, a handheld grout brush is perfect. Apply firm, even pressure and scrub in a back-and-forth motion.
*   **Power Scrubbing:** For larger areas, consider using a power scrubber with a grout brush attachment. This will save you time and effort. Be careful not to apply too much pressure, as you could damage the grout.
*   **Old Toothbrush:** An old toothbrush is great for getting into tight corners and around fixtures.

## Dealing with Stubborn Stains on Sanded Grout

Sometimes, DIY solutions aren’t enough. If you’re dealing with stubborn stains like mold, mildew, or deep-set dirt, you may need to step up your game.  Addressing these stains promptly is important to prevent them from becoming permanent.

### Oxygen Bleach (Oxiclean)

Oxygen bleach, like Oxiclean, is a powerful stain remover that’s safe for most grout types. Mix the powder with water according to the package directions and apply to the grout lines. Let it sit for 15-30 minutes, then scrub and rinse. You can find more information on [how to clean grout with Oxiclean](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-grout-with-oxiclean).

### Commercial Grout Cleaners

There are many commercial grout cleaners available. Choose a cleaner specifically designed for sanded grout and follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully. Always wear gloves and eye protection when using chemical cleaners.

## Preventing Future Stains: Sealing Your Grout

Once you’ve cleaned your sanded grout, the best way to keep it looking its best is to seal it. A grout sealer creates a protective barrier that prevents dirt, grime, and spills from penetrating the grout. 

*   **Choose the Right Sealer:** Look for a penetrating sealer specifically designed for sanded grout.
*   **Apply the Sealer:** Clean the grout thoroughly and allow it to dry completely. Apply the sealer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
*   **Reapply Regularly:** Grout sealer wears off over time, so reapply it every 6-12 months, or as needed.  You may want to consider cleaning your grout [before sealing](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-grout-before-sealing) to ensure the sealer adheres properly.
