## Keeping it Crystal Clear: How to Clean Your Blow Up Pool

Is your blow up pool looking a little less inviting and a little more…green? Don't worry, you're not alone! Maintaining a clean blow up pool is essential for a safe and enjoyable summer. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to keep your inflatable pool sparkling clean, from regular maintenance to tackling tougher issues. We’ll cover everything from daily skimming to deeper cleaning routines, ensuring your pool is always ready for a splash.

**Takeaway:**

*   Skim daily to remove debris.
*   Vacuum regularly to clear settled dirt.
*   Test and balance water chemistry weekly.
*   Shock the pool periodically to kill bacteria and algae.
*   Properly store the pool when not in use.

**Quick Answer:** Cleaning a blow up pool involves daily skimming, regular vacuuming, weekly water testing and balancing, occasional shocking, and proper storage. Consistent maintenance prevents algae growth and keeps the water safe for swimming.

## 1. Daily Maintenance: A Little Effort Goes a Long Way

Starting with a daily routine is the best way to prevent major cleaning headaches. A quick skim of the surface with a leaf skimmer removes leaves, bugs, and other floating debris before they sink and cause problems. This simple step significantly reduces the amount of dirt that settles at the bottom, making deeper cleaning less frequent. Think of it like tidying up as you go – it prevents a huge mess later!

Consider investing in a small, handheld pool skimmer specifically designed for inflatable pools. These are inexpensive and make the job much easier.  You can also use a pool cover when the pool isn’t in use to prevent debris from entering in the first place.

## 2. Vacuuming Your Blow Up Pool: Getting Rid of Settled Debris

Even with daily skimming, some dirt will inevitably settle at the bottom of your blow up pool. Vacuuming removes this settled debris, preventing it from clouding the water and becoming a breeding ground for bacteria.  You have a couple of options for vacuuming. A manual pool vacuum, connected to a filter pump, is a common choice. Alternatively, you can use a small, handheld vacuum designed for inflatable pools. 

When vacuuming, move slowly and methodically to ensure you cover the entire pool floor. Pay extra attention to corners and areas where debris tends to accumulate.  If you're struggling with particularly stubborn dirt, you might need to drain a small amount of water and scrub the bottom with a soft brush.

## 3. Water Chemistry: Balancing for a Safe Swim

Maintaining proper water chemistry is crucial for both sanitation and swimmer comfort. Regularly test the water for pH, alkalinity, and chlorine levels using a pool test kit or strips.  Ideal pH levels should be between 7.2 and 7.8.  Alkalinity should be between 80 and 120 ppm, and chlorine levels should be between 1 and 3 ppm.

Adjust the water chemistry as needed using pool chemicals.  Always follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.  Improperly balanced water can lead to skin irritation, eye discomfort, and algae growth.  Understanding your pool filter is also important; learn [how often should you clean the pool filter](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-often-should-you-clean-the-pool-filter) to ensure optimal water quality.

## 4. Shocking Your Blow Up Pool: A Periodic Deep Clean

Shocking your blow up pool involves adding a high dose of chlorine to kill bacteria, algae, and other contaminants. This is typically done weekly or bi-weekly, depending on pool usage and weather conditions.  Shocking is especially important after heavy rain or a large number of swimmers have used the pool.

Always shock the pool in the evening, as sunlight degrades chlorine.  Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully and allow the chlorine levels to return to normal before swimming.  Remember to circulate the water well after shocking to ensure the chlorine is evenly distributed.  If you're battling persistent algae, you might need to consider a stronger algaecide.

## 5. Dealing with Algae: Identifying and Eliminating Growth

Algae growth is a common problem in blow up pools, especially during warm weather.  Green algae is the most common type, but you may also encounter yellow or black algae.  Identifying algae early is key to preventing a major outbreak.  If you spot algae, brush the affected areas vigorously with a pool brush.

Then, shock the pool and add an algaecide.  Run the filter continuously until the algae is gone.  In severe cases, you may need to partially drain the pool and scrub the walls and floor with a chlorine solution.  Preventative measures, like consistent skimming, vacuuming, and water balancing, are the best way to avoid algae problems.

## 6. Cleaning the Pool Liner: Gentle Care for Inflatable Surfaces

The pool liner is the most delicate part of your blow up pool. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the material.  Instead, use a mild soap and water solution to clean the liner.  Gently scrub the surface with a soft cloth or sponge.

For stubborn stains, you can try a specialized pool liner cleaner.  Always test the cleaner in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn't cause discoloration.  Rinse the liner thoroughly with clean water after cleaning.  Pay attention to the area around the water line, as this is where dirt and grime tend to accumulate.

## 7. Proper Storage: Extending the Life of Your Pool

When the swimming season is over, proper storage is essential to protect your blow up pool and extend its lifespan.  Completely drain the pool and clean it thoroughly with a mild soap and water solution.  Rinse the pool thoroughly and allow it to dry completely.

Deflate the pool and fold it loosely.  Store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures.  Protect the pool from pests and rodents.  Following these storage tips will help ensure your blow up pool is ready for another summer of fun.
