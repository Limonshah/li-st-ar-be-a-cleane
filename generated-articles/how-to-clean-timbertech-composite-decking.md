## Understanding Timbertech Composite Decking & Cleaning Needs

Timbertech composite decking is made from a blend of wood fibers and plastic, offering a durable and attractive alternative to traditional wood. This composition makes it resistant to rot, warping, and insects, but it’s not entirely maintenance-free.  Dirt, pollen, algae, and food spills can accumulate over time, impacting the deck’s appearance. Understanding the specific needs of your Timbertech deck will help you choose the right cleaning approach.  Different Timbertech collections may have slightly different recommendations, so always check your warranty and product documentation.

## Routine Cleaning: Maintaining Your Deck’s Appearance

Regular cleaning is the best way to prevent buildup and keep your Timbertech deck looking its best.  A simple routine can save you a lot of effort in the long run.  Here’s how to incorporate routine cleaning into your deck maintenance schedule:

*   **Sweep Regularly:** Sweep your deck at least once a week to remove leaves, dirt, and other debris.
*   **Wash with Soap and Water:** Every few months, or as needed, wash the deck with a solution of mild dish soap and warm water.  Use a soft-bristled brush or mop to scrub the surface.
*   **Rinse Thoroughly:**  After washing, rinse the deck thoroughly with clean water to remove any soap residue.  You can use a garden hose with a gentle spray nozzle.
*   **Consider a Deck Cleaner:** For a deeper clean, you can use a Timbertech-approved deck cleaner. [https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-composite-deck](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-composite-deck) offers more information on composite deck cleaning.

*   **Oil and Grease:**  Absorb as much oil or grease as possible with paper towels. Then, apply a degreasing cleaner specifically designed for composite decking.
