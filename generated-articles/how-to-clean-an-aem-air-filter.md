## Revitalize Your Ride: How To Clean An AEM Air Filter

Is your engine feeling sluggish? A dirty air filter could be the culprit. An AEM air filter, known for its superior airflow, needs regular cleaning to maintain peak performance. This article will guide you through the process of cleaning your AEM air filter, ensuring your engine breathes easy and continues to deliver optimal power. We’ll cover everything from gathering supplies to the final drying steps, so you can keep your vehicle running smoothly. Let’s dive in and learn how to properly maintain this crucial component of your engine.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning extends the life of your AEM air filter.
*   Proper cleaning maintains optimal engine airflow and performance.
*   Using the correct cleaning kit is essential for AEM filters.
*   Allowing the filter to dry completely before reinstalling is crucial.

**Quick Answer:** Cleaning an AEM air filter involves removing it from your vehicle, applying AEM Air Filter Cleaner, letting it soak, rinsing with water, and allowing it to air dry completely before reinstalling. This process restores airflow and protects your engine.

## Understanding Your AEM Air Filter

AEM air filters are designed for increased airflow compared to standard paper filters. This enhanced airflow can lead to improved horsepower and acceleration. However, this also means they capture more dirt and debris. Unlike disposable paper filters, AEM filters are reusable, making regular cleaning a cost-effective and environmentally friendly practice. Understanding the filter’s construction – typically multiple layers of oiled cotton gauze – is key to cleaning it effectively. 

You should know that different AEM filters require slightly different care. For example, the AEM Dryflow air filter requires a different cleaning process than the oiled filters.

## Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Before you begin, ensure you have everything you need. Using the wrong products can damage your AEM filter, reducing its effectiveness. Here’s a checklist of essential supplies:

*   **AEM Air Filter Cleaner:** This is specifically formulated for AEM filters and won't harm the oiled cotton gauze.
*   **AEM Air Filter Oil:**  Needed to re-oil the filter after cleaning.
*   **Warm Water:** For rinsing the filter.
*   **Clean Bucket or Sink:** To contain the cleaning process.
*   **Soft Brush:** A soft-bristled brush can help loosen stubborn dirt.
*   **Clean Rags or Towels:** For drying.
*   **Gloves (Optional):** To protect your hands.

Avoid using harsh chemicals, solvents, or detergents, as these can damage the filter media. Using the correct AEM cleaning kit is vital for maintaining the filter’s performance and longevity.

## The Cleaning Process: Step-by-Step

Now, let's get to the cleaning! Follow these steps for a thorough and effective clean:

1.  **Remove the Filter:** Carefully remove the AEM air filter from your vehicle’s air intake housing.
2.  **Apply Cleaner:** Generously spray the AEM Air Filter Cleaner onto the dirty side of the filter. Ensure the entire surface is saturated.
3.  **Soak and Loosen Dirt:** Allow the cleaner to soak for at least 10-20 minutes. This allows the cleaner to break down the dirt and grime. Gently massage the cleaner into the filter media with a soft brush to loosen stubborn particles.
4.  **Rinse with Water:** Rinse the filter from the *clean* side to the dirty side with warm water. This prevents pushing dirt further into the filter media. Continue rinsing until the water runs clear.
5.  **Inspect for Damage:** Carefully inspect the filter for any tears or damage. If you find any, it’s time to replace the filter.
6.  **Air Dry Completely:** This is the most crucial step. Allow the filter to air dry *completely* – typically 24-48 hours – before re-oiling and reinstalling. Do *not* use compressed air or a heat source to speed up the drying process, as this can damage the filter.

## Re-Oiling Your AEM Air Filter

Once the filter is completely dry, it’s time to re-oil it. Oiling the filter is essential for trapping dirt and debris effectively. 

1.  **Apply Oil Evenly:** Apply AEM Air Filter Oil evenly across the entire filter media. Avoid over-oiling, as this can restrict airflow.
2.  **Allow Oil to Soak:** Let the oil soak into the filter media for about 20-30 minutes.
3.  **Check for Coverage:** Ensure the entire filter media is evenly coated with oil. You should see a slight sheen, but it shouldn’t be dripping wet.

Properly oiled, your AEM filter is ready to go back into your vehicle, providing optimal protection and performance. If you're unsure about the proper oiling technique, consider watching a tutorial video.

## How Often Should You Clean Your AEM Air Filter?

The frequency of cleaning depends on your driving conditions. If you frequently drive in dusty or dirty environments, you’ll need to clean your filter more often. As a general guideline:

*   **Normal Driving Conditions:** Clean every 25,000 - 50,000 miles.
*   **Dusty/Off-Road Conditions:** Clean every 10,000 - 25,000 miles.
*   **Regular Inspection:** Visually inspect your filter every month to check for excessive dirt buildup.

Regular maintenance, like cleaning your air filter, is crucial for maintaining your vehicle’s overall health. You can also find helpful information on how often to clean your cold air intake filter [here](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-often-to-clean-the-cold-air-intake-filter).

*   **Filter Won’t Dry:** Ensure adequate ventilation and allow sufficient drying time (24-48 hours).
*   **Oil is Unevenly Distributed:** Re-apply oil and gently massage it into the filter media.
*   **Filter is Damaged:** Replace the filter immediately. A damaged filter won’t provide adequate protection for your engine.
*   **Stubborn Dirt Remains:** Repeat the cleaning process, allowing the cleaner to soak for a longer period.
