## Revitalize Your Outdoor Space: How To Power Wash Pavers

Are your pavers looking dull and dirty? Power washing is a fantastic way to restore their original beauty and enhance your curb appeal. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about how to clean pavers with power washing, from preparation to execution, ensuring a safe and effective cleaning process. We’ll cover the right techniques, essential safety precautions, and how to avoid common mistakes.

**Takeaway:**

*   Choose the right nozzle and pressure setting for your paver type.
*   Always pre-sweep and consider a cleaning solution for stubborn stains.
*   Work in overlapping passes and maintain a consistent distance from the pavers.
*   Re-sand joints after cleaning to maintain stability and appearance.

Power washing pavers is a straightforward process when done correctly. It’s an effective method for removing dirt, grime, algae, and even some stains from your paved surfaces. Let’s dive into the details to get your pavers looking their best!

### Understanding Your Pavers & Power Washer

Before you start, it’s important to understand both your pavers and your power washer. Different paver materials require different approaches. Brick pavers, for example, are more porous than concrete pavers and may need a lower pressure setting. Similarly, knowing your power washer’s capabilities – its PSI (pounds per square inch) and GPM (gallons per minute) – is crucial. 

*   **Paver Types:** Common types include brick, concrete, natural stone (like bluestone or travertine), and permeable pavers. [https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-concrete-pavers](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-concrete-pavers) offers more detail on cleaning concrete pavers specifically.
*   **Power Washer Settings:** Most power washers have adjustable nozzles. A wider nozzle (40-degree) delivers lower pressure, while a narrower nozzle (15-degree) delivers higher pressure.
*   **PSI Considerations:** Generally, 1500-3000 PSI is sufficient for most paver cleaning. Avoid exceeding 3000 PSI, especially on softer materials.

### Preparing Your Pavers for Power Washing

Proper preparation is key to a successful power washing job. This step ensures a more thorough clean and minimizes the risk of damage. Start by removing any furniture, planters, or other objects from the area. Then, sweep the pavers thoroughly to remove loose debris like leaves, dirt, and sand. 

*   **Sweep First:** A stiff-bristled broom is ideal for this task.
*   **Pre-Treat Stains:** For stubborn stains like oil or grease, consider using a paver cleaner or degreaser. [https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-oil-off-pavers](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-oil-off-pavers) provides a detailed guide on removing oil stains.
*   **Protect Surroundings:** Cover any nearby plants or sensitive surfaces with plastic sheeting to protect them from the spray.

### Choosing the Right Nozzle and Pressure

Selecting the correct nozzle and pressure setting is arguably the most important step. Using too much pressure can erode the pavers, damage the joint sand, and even create unsightly etching. Start with a wider nozzle (40-degree) and test a small, inconspicuous area. 

*   **Start Low:** Begin with the lowest pressure setting and gradually increase it until you achieve the desired cleaning results.
*   **Nozzle Selection:** A 25-degree nozzle is a good all-around choice for most paver types. Avoid using a 0-degree nozzle, as it’s too powerful and can cause damage.
*   **Distance Matters:** Maintain a consistent distance of at least 8-12 inches from the pavers.

### The Power Washing Process: Step-by-Step

Now it’s time to start power washing! Work in a systematic manner to ensure even cleaning. Begin by wetting the pavers with water to loosen any remaining dirt. Then, using overlapping passes, slowly move the power washer wand across the surface. 

*   **Overlapping Passes:** Overlap each pass by about 50% to avoid leaving streaks or unevenly cleaned areas.
*   **Consistent Speed:** Maintain a consistent speed and distance throughout the process.
*   **Direction:** Work *with* the paver joints, not across them, to avoid dislodging the sand.
*   **Rinse Thoroughly:** After cleaning, rinse the pavers thoroughly with clean water to remove any remaining detergent or debris.

### Dealing with Specific Paver Issues

Different paver issues require slightly different approaches. Moss and algae can be particularly stubborn, while polymeric sand requires extra care. Here’s how to tackle common problems:

*   **Moss and Algae:** Use a paver cleaner specifically designed to kill moss and algae. Allow it to dwell for the recommended time before power washing. [https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-moss-off-pavers](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-moss-off-pavers) offers more specific advice.
*   **Polymeric Sand:** Be extremely careful when power washing pavers with polymeric sand. Use a very low pressure setting and a wide nozzle to avoid washing away the sand. [https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-polymeric-sand-off-pavers](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-polymeric-sand-off-pavers) provides guidance on cleaning around polymeric sand.
*   **Efflorescence:** This white, powdery substance is caused by salt deposits. A mild acidic cleaner can help remove it, but always test in an inconspicuous area first.

### Post-Cleaning: Re-Sanding and Sealing

After power washing, it’s important to re-sand the joints between the pavers. This helps stabilize the pavers and prevents weed growth. Use a polymeric sand specifically designed for pavers, as it’s more durable and resistant to erosion. 

*   **Re-Sanding:** Sweep the polymeric sand into the joints, ensuring they are completely filled.
*   **Water Activation:** Lightly mist the pavers with water to activate the polymeric sand.
*   **Sealing (Optional):** Consider sealing your pavers to protect them from stains and weathering. [https://www.beacleaner.com/how-much-to-clean-and-seal-pavers](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-much-to-clean-and-seal-pavers) can help you determine if sealing is right for you.



### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can I use bleach to clean my pavers?**
A: While bleach can kill algae, it’s not recommended for pavers. It can discolor the pavers, harm plants, and is environmentally unfriendly. Opt for a paver-specific cleaner instead.

**Q: How often should I power wash my pavers?**
A: Generally, once or twice a year is sufficient. However, areas with heavy foot traffic or exposure to harsh weather may require more frequent cleaning.

**Q: What if my pavers are still stained after power washing?**
A: Try using a specialized stain remover designed for pavers. You may also need to increase the pressure slightly, but be careful not to damage the pavers.

**Q: Is it safe to power wash pavers near plants?**
A: It can be, but you need to take precautions. Cover plants with plastic sheeting and avoid spraying them directly with the power washer.

**Q: What pressure setting should I use for brick pavers?**
A: Brick pavers are softer than concrete, so use a lower pressure setting (around 1500-2000 PSI) and a wider nozzle (40-degree).



In conclusion, learning how to clean pavers with power washing is a rewarding task that can significantly improve the appearance of your outdoor living space. Remember to prioritize safety, choose the right tools and techniques, and always test in an inconspicuous area first. With a little effort, you can restore your pavers to their former glory and enjoy a beautiful, clean outdoor area for years to come.
