## Keeping Your Kicks Fresh: How To Clean Yeezy Boost 700s

Let's face it: Yeezy Boost 700s are an investment. You want them to look their best for as long as possible. Cleaning these stylish sneakers doesn’t have to be a daunting task. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to safely and effectively clean your Yeezy Boost 700s, keeping them in top condition. We’ll cover everything from daily maintenance to tackling tougher stains, ensuring your Yeezys stay looking fresh.

**Takeaway:**

*   Use a soft brush to remove loose dirt.
*   Mix mild soap with lukewarm water for cleaning.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals and excessive water.
*   Air dry your Yeezys away from direct sunlight.

**Quick Answer:** To clean Yeezy Boost 700s, gently brush off loose dirt, mix a small amount of mild soap with lukewarm water, and use a soft cloth to wipe down the upper and midsole. Avoid soaking the shoes and air dry them naturally, away from direct heat or sunlight.

## Understanding Your Yeezy Boost 700 Materials

Before diving into the cleaning process, it’s important to understand what your Yeezy Boost 700s are made of. Different materials require different approaches. The Yeezy Boost 700 typically features a combination of engineered mesh, leather, and suede, all sitting atop the signature Boost midsole. Knowing this helps you choose the right cleaning methods.  Using the wrong products can damage the delicate materials, so understanding the composition is key to successful cleaning.  For example, suede requires a more gentle touch than leather.

## Daily Maintenance for Long-Lasting Yeezys

Preventative care is the best way to keep your Yeezy Boost 700s clean. A little effort each day can save you a lot of work later. After each wear, take a few minutes to wipe down your shoes with a soft, dry cloth. This removes loose dirt and dust before they become embedded in the materials. Consider using a sneaker protector spray to create a barrier against stains and water damage.  This simple step can significantly extend the life and appearance of your Yeezys.

## Deep Cleaning Your Yeezy Boost 700s: Step-by-Step

When your Yeezys need a more thorough cleaning, follow these steps. First, gather your supplies: a soft-bristled brush, a clean cloth, mild soap (dish soap works well), and lukewarm water.  Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the materials. 

1.  **Remove Loose Dirt:** Use the soft brush to gently remove any loose dirt or debris from the upper, midsole, and outsole.
2.  **Prepare Cleaning Solution:** Mix a small amount of mild soap with lukewarm water.
3.  **Clean the Upper:** Dip the cloth into the cleaning solution and gently wipe down the upper of the shoe. Avoid soaking the material.
4.  **Clean the Midsole:** Use the same cleaning solution to wipe down the Boost midsole. Be careful not to get water inside the shoe.
5.  **Clean the Outsole:** For tougher dirt on the outsole, you can use a slightly stiffer brush.
6.  **Rinse and Dry:** Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe away any remaining soap residue. Allow the shoes to air dry completely, away from direct sunlight or heat.

## Tackling Specific Stains on Your Yeezys

Different stains require different approaches. Here’s how to handle some common issues:

*   **Mud:** Let the mud dry completely, then gently brush it off with a soft brush. If any residue remains, use the cleaning solution described above.
*   **Oil/Grease:** Sprinkle baking soda on the stain and let it sit for several hours to absorb the oil. Then, brush off the baking soda and clean the area with the mild soap solution.
*   **Scuff Marks:** For minor scuff marks on the leather or suede, a suede eraser can often do the trick.  For more stubborn marks, consider a specialized leather cleaner.
*   **Yellowing of the Midsole:** While completely reversing yellowing can be difficult, regular cleaning and avoiding prolonged exposure to sunlight can help prevent it. You can also explore specialized midsole cleaning products.

## Protecting Your Yeezys After Cleaning

Once your Yeezys are clean, it’s important to protect them. Applying a sneaker protector spray will help repel water and stains, making future cleaning easier. Store your Yeezys in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight. Consider using shoe trees to help maintain their shape.  Proper storage can significantly extend the life of your sneakers.  You might also want to consider rotating your Yeezys with other shoes to prevent excessive wear and tear on any single pair.

## Cleaning the Yeezy Boost 700 V2: Specific Considerations

The Yeezy Boost 700 V2 has some unique design elements that require a little extra attention. The reflective details on the V2 can be delicate, so avoid using abrasive cleaners or brushes on those areas. The textured upper can also trap dirt, so be sure to use a brush to get into all the crevices.  Pay close attention to the areas where the different materials meet, as these can be prone to dirt buildup.
