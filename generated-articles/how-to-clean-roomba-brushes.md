## Keeping Your Floors Sparkling: How to Clean Roomba Brushes

Is your Roomba not picking up as much dirt as it used to? The culprit is likely tangled, dirty brushes. Cleaning your Roomba brushes regularly is essential for maintaining its cleaning power and extending its lifespan. This article will guide you through everything you need to know about cleaning your Roomba’s brushes, ensuring your floors stay spotless. We’ll cover different brush types and provide step-by-step instructions for a thorough clean.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly remove hair and debris from your Roomba brushes.
*   Deep clean brushes with appropriate tools for optimal performance.
*   Inspect brushes for wear and tear and replace them when necessary.

**Quick Answer:** To clean Roomba brushes, remove them from the robot, use a cleaning tool (like a brush or hook) to cut and remove tangled hair and debris, and then wipe them clean with a damp cloth.

## Understanding Your Roomba Brush Types

Roombas come with different brush systems depending on the model. Knowing your brush type is the first step to cleaning it effectively. There are generally three main types: dual multi-surface brushes, extractors, and side brushes. Each requires a slightly different approach to cleaning. 

*   **Dual Multi-Surface Brushes:** These are the most common type, featuring two counter-rotating brushes designed for both carpets and hard floors. They often accumulate a lot of hair and fibers.
*   **Extractors (Rubber Brushes):** Found on newer models, these flexible rubber brushes are excellent at grabbing pet hair and debris without tangling as easily.
*   **Side Brushes:** These small, spinning brushes sweep debris from edges and corners into the path of the main brushes. They need regular cleaning to maintain their effectiveness.

## Removing Tangled Hair and Debris

The most frequent cleaning task is removing tangled hair, string, and other debris from the brushes. This buildup significantly reduces cleaning performance. Fortunately, it’s a relatively simple process.

1.  **Turn off your Roomba:** Always power down your robot before performing any maintenance.
2.  **Remove the brushes:** Consult your Roomba’s manual for specific instructions on removing the brush assembly. It usually involves releasing a latch or two.
3.  **Use a cleaning tool:** A dedicated Roomba brush cleaning tool is ideal, but a small hook, seam ripper, or even scissors can work. Carefully cut and remove tangled hair and debris. Be gentle to avoid damaging the brushes.
4.  **Inspect for damage:** While cleaning, check the brushes for any signs of wear and tear, such as bent bristles or cracks. If damaged, consider replacing them.

## Deep Cleaning Your Roomba Brushes

After removing the tangled debris, it’s time for a more thorough cleaning. This will remove dust, dirt, and any remaining residue.

1.  **Rinse with water:** Rinse the brushes under lukewarm water. Avoid using hot water, as it could damage the bristles.
2.  **Use a mild detergent (optional):** If the brushes are particularly dirty, you can add a small amount of mild dish soap to the water.
3.  **Scrub gently:** Use a soft brush or cloth to gently scrub the brushes, removing any remaining dirt.
4.  **Rinse thoroughly:** Ensure all soap residue is removed by rinsing the brushes thoroughly with clean water.
5.  **Dry completely:** Allow the brushes to air dry completely before reinstalling them in your Roomba. This is crucial to prevent mold and mildew growth.

## Cleaning Rubber Extractors

Rubber extractors require slightly different care than bristle brushes. While they don’t tangle as easily, they can still accumulate hair and debris.

1.  **Remove the extractors:** Follow your Roomba’s manual to remove the rubber extractors.
2.  **Pull out the bearings:** The yellow bearings inside the extractors often collect hair. Pull them out and remove any wrapped debris.
3.  **Rinse and scrub:** Rinse the extractors and bearings under lukewarm water, scrubbing gently with a soft brush if needed.
4.  **Dry completely:** Ensure both the extractors and bearings are completely dry before reassembling and reinstalling them.

## Maintaining Your Roomba Side Brush

Don’t forget about the side brush! It plays a vital role in edge cleaning.

1.  **Remove the side brush:** Typically, you can remove the side brush by unscrewing it or simply pulling it off.
2.  **Remove debris:** Remove any tangled hair or debris from the brush and its housing.
3.  **Wipe clean:** Wipe the brush with a damp cloth.
4.  **Reinstall:** Reattach the side brush securely.

## When to Replace Your Roomba Brushes

Even with regular cleaning, Roomba brushes will eventually wear out. Here are some signs it’s time for a replacement:

*   **Bent or broken bristles:** Damaged bristles won’t effectively sweep up dirt.
*   **Worn rubber:** Rubber extractors can lose their flexibility over time, reducing their cleaning power.
*   **Reduced cleaning performance:** If your Roomba isn’t picking up dirt as well as it used to, even after cleaning the brushes, it’s likely time for a replacement.
*   **Visible wear and tear:** If the brushes look significantly worn or damaged, it’s best to replace them.

Replacing your brushes is a simple process and will significantly improve your Roomba’s cleaning performance. You can find replacement brushes on the iRobot website or from other retailers.
