## Keeping Your Sparkle: How to Clean Lab Created Diamonds

Do you want your lab created diamond to shine as brilliantly as the day you got it?  Lab grown diamonds, while incredibly durable, still attract dirt, oils, and lotions that can diminish their sparkle.  Fortunately, cleaning your lab created diamond is a simple process you can easily do at home. This article will guide you through the best methods for cleaning your diamond jewelry, ensuring it continues to dazzle for years to come. We’ll cover everything from daily quick cleans to deeper cleaning techniques.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning maintains brilliance.
*   Mild soap and warm water are usually sufficient.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive materials.
*   Professional cleaning is recommended periodically.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean your lab created diamond, soak it in warm water with a mild dish soap for 20-30 minutes, then gently scrub with a soft brush. Rinse thoroughly and dry with a lint-free cloth. This simple process removes dirt and oils, restoring your diamond’s sparkle.

## Why Clean Your Lab Created Diamonds?

Even though lab created diamonds share the same physical and chemical properties as mined diamonds, they still benefit from regular cleaning.  Daily wear exposes them to substances that dull their brilliance.  Things like hand lotion, makeup, and even household dust can accumulate on the surface, preventing light from entering and reflecting.  A clean diamond will appear larger, brighter, and more beautiful.  Plus, taking good care of your jewelry extends its lifespan and protects your investment.

## The Daily Quick Clean: Maintaining the Sparkle

For a quick refresh, a simple warm water rinse is often enough.  This is perfect for removing surface dust and grime that accumulates throughout the day.  Fill a small bowl with warm water and gently swirl your diamond jewelry around.  You can also use a very soft toothbrush to lightly brush away any visible dirt.  Be sure to close the drain!  This quick clean takes just a few minutes and can significantly improve your diamond’s appearance.  It’s a great habit to get into after wearing your jewelry.

## The Soap and Water Method: A Deeper Clean

For a more thorough cleaning, use a mild dish soap and warm water.  This method effectively removes oils and buildup that a simple rinse won’t touch.  Mix a few drops of dish soap (like Dawn) into a bowl of warm water.  Soak your diamond jewelry in the solution for 20-30 minutes.  After soaking, gently scrub the diamond and setting with a soft-bristled toothbrush.  Pay attention to the underside of the diamond, as this is where dirt often accumulates.  Rinse thoroughly under warm running water and dry with a lint-free cloth.

## Choosing the Right Cleaning Tools

Using the correct tools is crucial to avoid damaging your lab created diamond or its setting.  Avoid abrasive materials like baking soda or toothpaste, as these can scratch the metal or the diamond itself.  A soft-bristled toothbrush is ideal for scrubbing, and a lint-free cloth (like microfiber) is best for drying.  Avoid using paper towels, as they can leave behind lint.  You might also consider investing in a specialized jewelry cleaning brush, which is designed to reach tight spaces.  If you're unsure about cleaning a particularly delicate setting, consider taking it to a professional jeweler.

## What to Avoid When Cleaning Your Diamond

Certain cleaning agents can be harmful to your lab created diamond and its setting.  Harsh chemicals like bleach, chlorine, and ammonia should be avoided at all costs.  These chemicals can damage the metal and potentially affect the diamond’s clarity.  Also, avoid using ultrasonic cleaners if your diamond is set in a delicate or porous metal like platinum or gold with intricate details.  While ultrasonic cleaners can be effective, they can also loosen stones or damage the setting.  Finally, never attempt to clean your diamond while wearing it, as the soap and water could irritate your skin.

## Professional Cleaning: When to Seek Expert Help

While you can effectively clean your lab created diamond at home, professional cleaning is still recommended periodically.  A jeweler has specialized tools and expertise to thoroughly clean your jewelry and inspect it for any potential damage.  They can also polish the metal to restore its shine.  It’s a good idea to have your diamond jewelry professionally cleaned at least once a year, or more often if you wear it frequently.  This ensures your diamond remains brilliant and your setting is secure.  If you have a complex setting, like [baguette diamonds](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-baguette-diamonds), professional cleaning is especially recommended.
