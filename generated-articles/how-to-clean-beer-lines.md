## Keeping Your Draft Delicious: How to Clean Beer Lines

Cleaning your beer lines regularly is crucial for maintaining beer quality, preventing off-flavors, and ensuring a great pour every time. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about how to clean beer lines, from the necessary supplies to a step-by-step cleaning process. We’ll cover everything to keep your system running smoothly and your customers (or yourself!) happy.

**Takeaway:**

**What does it mean to clean beer lines?**

Cleaning beer lines involves removing beer stone, yeast, and other organic matter that accumulates inside the lines over time. This buildup can harbor bacteria, lead to off-flavors, and restrict beer flow.

## Why is Cleaning Your Beer Lines So Important?

Let's face it, nobody wants a stale or sour beer. Beer lines, while seemingly simple, are breeding grounds for unwanted microorganisms if not properly maintained. Over time, proteins, sugars, and yeast left behind after pouring create a sticky residue known as beer stone. This beer stone isn’t just unsightly; it impacts the taste of your beer, leading to sour, cheesy, or even moldy flavors. Regular cleaning prevents this buildup, ensuring each pint delivers the intended flavor profile.  Beyond taste, clean lines also improve beer flow and reduce the risk of line clogging. 

## Gathering Your Beer Line Cleaning Supplies

Before you start, you’ll need to assemble the right tools. Don't worry, it's not a huge list! Here’s what you’ll need to effectively clean your beer lines:

*   **Cleaning Solution:** Specifically designed for beer lines (like PBW or similar). Avoid harsh chemicals.
*   **Circulating Pump:** A dedicated beer line cleaning pump is ideal, but a hand pump can work for shorter lines.
*   **Cleaning Bucket:** Food-grade plastic bucket for your cleaning solution.
*   **Rinsing Solution:** Purified water for rinsing.
*   **Line Cleaning Brush:** For stubborn buildup (optional, but helpful).
*   **Fittings & Adapters:** To connect your pump and lines.
*   **Sanitizer:** After cleaning, sanitize the lines to eliminate any remaining bacteria. [https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-barbell](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-barbell) can help you understand the importance of sanitization.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Your Beer Lines

Now for the main event! Here’s a detailed breakdown of how to clean your beer lines:

1.  **Disconnect the Lines:** Carefully disconnect the beer lines from the keg coupler and faucet.
2.  **Prepare the Cleaning Solution:** Mix your cleaning solution according to the manufacturer’s instructions in your cleaning bucket.
3.  **Connect the Pump:** Attach the circulating pump to the cleaning bucket and connect the beer line to the pump’s inlet.
4.  **Circulate the Cleaning Solution:** Turn on the pump and circulate the cleaning solution through the line for at least 15-20 minutes. This ensures thorough cleaning.
5.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Discard the cleaning solution and replace it with purified water. Circulate the water through the line until all traces of the cleaning solution are gone. This is *crucial* – residual cleaner can ruin your next batch.
6.  **Sanitize the Lines:** Prepare a sanitizing solution and circulate it through the lines following the manufacturer’s instructions.
7.  **Reconnect the Lines:** Carefully reconnect the lines to the keg coupler and faucet.

## Understanding Cleaning Frequency: How Often Should You Clean?

The frequency of cleaning depends on beer volume and line length. A good rule of thumb is to clean your beer lines every two weeks if you’re dispensing a significant amount of beer. If you have a smaller system or slower turnover, cleaning once a month may suffice. However, *always* clean the lines before switching beer styles to prevent flavor contamination.  Consider cleaning more frequently during peak seasons or if you notice any off-flavors.  Regular maintenance is far easier than dealing with a severely clogged system.

## Dealing with Stubborn Beer Stone & Clogs

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, beer stone can build up and cause stubborn clogs. Here are a few tips for tackling these issues:

*   **Soaking:** Disconnect the line and soak it in a concentrated cleaning solution overnight.
*   **Line Brush:** Use a line cleaning brush to physically scrub away the buildup.
*   **Backflushing:** Circulate the cleaning solution in both directions to dislodge stubborn clogs.
*   **Professional Cleaning:** If you’re unable to resolve the issue, consider contacting a professional draft system cleaning service.  They have specialized equipment and expertise to handle even the most challenging situations.

## Maintaining Your Draft System: Beyond the Lines

Cleaning your beer lines is a vital part of draft system maintenance, but it’s not the only step.  Regularly cleaning your faucets, couplers, and even the inside of your kegs is equally important.  A comprehensive cleaning schedule will ensure your entire system is functioning optimally.  Don't forget to inspect your lines for cracks or damage and replace them as needed.  A small leak can lead to oxidation and off-flavors.  Keeping your system clean and well-maintained will save you money and headaches in the long run.
