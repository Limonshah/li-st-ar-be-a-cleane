## A Sparkling Clean Start: How To Clean A Drained Hot Tub

Is your hot tub looking a little less inviting? Don't worry, a thorough cleaning after draining is key to keeping it hygienic and enjoyable. Cleaning a drained hot tub might seem daunting, but it’s a manageable task that will extend the life of your spa and ensure a relaxing experience every time. This article will walk you through each step, from initial scrubbing to final sanitization, so you can confidently maintain a pristine hot tub. We’ll cover everything you need to know to get your spa sparkling clean and ready for your next soak.

**Takeaway:**

*   Drain the hot tub completely.
*   Clean the shell and jets with a hot tub cleaner.
*   Clean or replace the filter.
*   Rinse thoroughly before refilling.
*   Sanitize before refilling.

**Quick Answer:** To clean a drained hot tub, start by removing any debris, then scrub the shell and jets with a hot tub-specific cleaner. Next, clean or replace the filter, rinse everything thoroughly, and finally, sanitize the tub before refilling it with fresh water.

## 1. Preparing for a Deep Clean: Initial Drain & Debris Removal

Before you even think about scrubbing, ensure your hot tub is completely drained. This is the first and most important step in how to clean a drained hot tub. Once the water is gone, take a look inside and remove any loose debris like leaves, twigs, or anything else that settled at the bottom. A wet/dry vacuum can be incredibly helpful for this stage, especially for getting into corners. 

After removing the larger pieces, inspect the hot tub shell for any visible grime or buildup. This initial assessment will help you determine how much cleaning solution you’ll need and where to focus your efforts. Don’t underestimate this step; removing debris upfront makes the rest of the cleaning process much easier.

## 2. The Power of a Hot Tub Cleaner: Shell & Jet Scrubbing

Now it’s time to tackle the grime with a dedicated hot tub cleaner. Avoid using household cleaners like bleach or dish soap, as these can damage the hot tub’s surface and affect water chemistry later on. Instead, choose a cleaner specifically formulated for acrylic or your hot tub’s shell material. 

Spray the cleaner liberally over the entire interior surface of the hot tub, paying close attention to areas prone to buildup, like around the jets and seats. Let the cleaner sit for the recommended time (usually 10-15 minutes) to loosen dirt and grime. Then, using a soft brush or sponge (avoid abrasive materials!), scrub the shell and jets thoroughly. For stubborn stains, you might need to apply a little extra elbow grease. Remember to scrub inside the jets themselves to remove any biofilm buildup.

## 3. Filter Focus: Cleaning or Replacing Your Hot Tub Filter

The filter is the heart of your hot tub’s cleaning system, so it needs special attention. A dirty filter reduces water flow and can harbor bacteria. When you clean a drained hot tub, it’s the perfect time to address the filter. Remove the filter and inspect it. If it’s heavily soiled or damaged, it’s best to replace it. 

If the filter is still in good condition, you can clean it. Rinse it thoroughly with a garden hose, using a filter cleaning solution to remove oils and debris. Allow the filter to dry completely before reinstalling it. Regularly cleaning your filter will significantly improve your hot tub’s water quality.

## 4. Rinse, Rinse, Rinse: Removing Cleaner Residue

After scrubbing and filter maintenance, thorough rinsing is crucial. You need to remove all traces of the cleaning solution before refilling the hot tub. Use a garden hose to rinse the entire interior surface of the hot tub, ensuring no cleaner residue remains. 

Pay special attention to crevices and areas around the jets. Continue rinsing until the water runs clear. Any remaining cleaner can cause foaming or affect the water chemistry when you refill the tub. This step is often overlooked, but it’s essential for a clean and safe hot tub experience.

## 5. Sanitization Step: Preparing for Refilling

Even after cleaning, it’s important to sanitize the hot tub shell before refilling. This helps eliminate any remaining bacteria or microorganisms. You can use a hot tub sanitizing solution specifically designed for this purpose. 

Follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully, as the concentration and application method may vary. Typically, you’ll add the sanitizer to the empty hot tub and let it circulate for a short period before draining it again. This final sanitization step ensures your hot tub is completely clean and ready for a fresh start.

## 6. Inspecting Plumbing & Equipment (Optional, But Recommended)

While the hot tub is drained, it’s a good opportunity to inspect the plumbing and equipment. Look for any leaks or signs of damage. Check the pump, heater, and other components for proper functioning. 

Addressing any issues now can prevent more significant problems down the road. If you’re not comfortable performing these inspections yourself, consider contacting a qualified hot tub technician. Maintaining your hot tub’s equipment is just as important as cleaning the shell.

## 7. Refilling & Balancing: The Final Touches

Once you’ve completed the cleaning and sanitization process, you can begin refilling the hot tub. Use a pre-filter on your hose to remove any impurities from the water. As you fill the tub, test the water chemistry and adjust the pH, alkalinity, and sanitizer levels as needed. 

Balancing the water is essential for a comfortable and safe soaking experience. Refer to your hot tub’s manual for specific water chemistry guidelines. Once the water is balanced, you’re ready to enjoy your sparkling clean hot tub!
