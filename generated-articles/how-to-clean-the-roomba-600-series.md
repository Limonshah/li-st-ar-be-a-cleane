## Keeping Your Floors Sparkling: How To Clean A Roomba 600 Series

Is your Roomba 600 Series not picking up as much dirt as it used to? Regular cleaning is the key to maintaining its performance and extending its lifespan. A clean Roomba means cleaner floors and less hassle for you. This article will walk you through a comprehensive cleaning routine for your Roomba 600 Series, ensuring it continues to be your reliable cleaning companion. We’ll cover everything from emptying the dustbin to cleaning the brushes and sensors.

**Takeaway:**

*   Empty the dustbin after each use.
*   Clean the brushes regularly to remove hair and debris.
*   Wipe down the sensors for optimal navigation.
*   Periodically check and clean the wheels.



**Quick Answer:** To clean your Roomba 600 Series, empty the dustbin after each use, clean the brushes and rollers weekly, wipe the sensors monthly, and check the wheels for debris. This simple routine will keep your robot vacuum performing at its best.

## 1. Emptying the Roomba 600 Series Dust Bin

The dust bin is the first place you should focus your cleaning efforts.  Emptying it after *every* use prevents buildup that can reduce suction power. A full bin forces the Roomba to work harder, shortening its runtime and potentially damaging the motor. To empty the bin, simply press the release button and dispose of the contents into a trash can. 

For a deeper clean, you can remove the bin completely and rinse it with water. Make sure it’s completely dry before placing it back into the Roomba.  Don't forget to check the filter inside the dustbin; a clogged filter significantly impacts performance. You can find more information on [how to clean a Roomba filter](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-roomba-filter) to ensure optimal suction.

## 2. Cleaning the Brushes and Extractors

The brushes and extractors are responsible for sweeping up dirt and debris. They are prone to getting tangled with hair, string, and other materials. Regularly cleaning these components is crucial for maintaining suction and preventing damage. 

Here’s how to clean them:

*   **Remove the Brushes:** Most Roomba 600 Series models have brushes that easily snap out.
*   **Remove Debris:** Use the included cleaning tool (or scissors) to carefully remove any hair, string, or debris wrapped around the brushes.
*   **Inspect the Bearings:** Check the brush bearings for buildup. Clean them with a dry cloth.
*   **Clean the Extractors:** The rubber extractors also collect debris. Remove them and clean them similarly to the brushes.

## 3. Maintaining the Roomba 600 Series Wheels

The wheels allow your Roomba to move around your home. They can accumulate dirt, dust, and hair, affecting their ability to grip the floor.  This can lead to reduced cleaning efficiency and even cause the Roomba to get stuck. 

To clean the wheels:

*   **Inspect the Wheels:** Look for any visible debris wrapped around the axles.
*   **Remove Debris:** Use a dry cloth or the included cleaning tool to remove any accumulated dirt and hair.
*   **Check for Smooth Rotation:** Ensure the wheels rotate freely. If they are stiff, gently try to loosen them.

## 4. Wiping Down the Sensors

Your Roomba 600 Series relies on sensors to navigate your home and avoid obstacles. Dust and dirt can accumulate on these sensors, hindering their performance.  Regularly wiping them down ensures accurate navigation and prevents the Roomba from bumping into furniture or falling down stairs.

*   **Locate the Sensors:** The Roomba 600 Series typically has cliff sensors on the bottom and a wall-following sensor on the side.
*   **Use a Soft Cloth:** Gently wipe the sensors with a clean, dry, soft cloth. Avoid using any liquids or abrasive cleaners.
*   **Check for Obstructions:** Ensure there are no obstructions blocking the sensors.
*   For more information on keeping your sensors in top shape, see this guide on [how to clean Roomba sensors](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-roomba-sensors).

## 5. Cleaning the Charging Contacts

The charging contacts are essential for your Roomba to recharge.  Dirt and debris can build up on these contacts, preventing a proper connection. This can result in the Roomba not charging correctly or taking longer to fully charge.

*   **Locate the Contacts:** The charging contacts are usually located on the top of the Roomba and on the charging base.
*   **Use a Dry Cloth:** Gently wipe the contacts with a clean, dry cloth.
*   **Avoid Liquids:** Do not use any liquids to clean the charging contacts.
*   You can find more information on [how to clean Roomba charging contacts](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-roomba-charging-contacts) to ensure a reliable charge.

## 6. Addressing Common Roomba 600 Series Issues

Sometimes, even with regular cleaning, your Roomba might encounter issues. Here are a few common problems and how to address them:

*   **Roomba isn’t picking up dirt:** Check the dustbin, filter, and brushes for clogs.
*   **Roomba is getting stuck:** Ensure there are no small objects or cords obstructing its path.  Consider using virtual walls to restrict access to problem areas. You can learn more about preventing this with [how to prevent Roomba from getting stuck](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-prevent-roomba-from-getting-stuck).
*   **Roomba is making unusual noises:** Check the brushes and wheels for obstructions.
*   **Roomba isn’t returning to the base:** Clean the charging contacts and ensure the base is properly plugged in.



## 7. Deep Cleaning the Roomba Bin for Optimal Performance

Beyond simply emptying the dust bin, a deep clean can significantly improve your Roomba’s performance.  This involves removing the bin and thoroughly washing it with mild soap and water.  Pay close attention to any crevices where dirt might accumulate. 

Remember to completely dry the bin before reassembling it. A damp bin can damage the internal components.  Regularly cleaning the bin prevents odors and ensures optimal airflow.
