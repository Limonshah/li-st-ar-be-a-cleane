## Preparing Your Ruggable for Washing

Before you toss your Ruggable into the washing machine, a little preparation goes a long way. First, completely remove the rug cover from the non-slip pad. The rug cover is the washable part, while the pad should *not* go in the washing machine. You can find detailed instructions on separating the two on the Ruggable website.  Once separated, give the rug cover a good shake to remove any loose dirt or debris. 

Next, inspect the rug for any stubborn stains.  Pre-treating these spots with a mild stain remover can significantly improve the washing results.  For general cleaning, you can also use a vacuum cleaner to remove any remaining dust or particles.  Remember to check the care label on your Ruggable for any specific instructions or warnings.  If you're unsure about a particular stain, consider testing the stain remover on an inconspicuous area of the rug first.

## Washing Your Ruggable Rug Cover

Now for the main event: washing the Ruggable rug cover!  Always use a washing machine without a center agitator to prevent damage. A front-loading machine is ideal, but a top-loading machine *without* an agitator will also work. Place the rug cover inside the washing machine, ensuring it’s not overly crammed.  

Use cold water and a mild, liquid detergent. Avoid using bleach or harsh chemicals, as these can discolor or damage the rug fibers. A gentle cycle is best, and you can add a cup of white vinegar to help brighten the colors and remove any lingering odors.  Don't overload the machine; washing one rug cover at a time is recommended for optimal cleaning.

## Drying Your Ruggable – The Right Way

Drying your Ruggable correctly is just as important as washing it. Avoid using a dryer, as the high heat can cause the rug to shrink or become damaged. Instead, lay the rug cover flat to air dry, or hang it over a clothesline. 

Ensure the rug is completely dry before reattaching it to the pad.  This prevents mildew and odors from developing.  Depending on the humidity and temperature, drying can take several hours or even a full day.  You can speed up the process by placing a fan nearby to circulate air.  Never expose the rug to direct sunlight for extended periods, as this can cause fading.

## Dealing with Stubborn Stains on Your Ruggable

Even with regular washing, stubborn stains can sometimes appear on your Ruggable.  Act quickly when dealing with spills, as the longer a stain sits, the harder it will be to remove.  Blot the stain immediately with a clean cloth, working from the outside in to prevent it from spreading. 

For food stains, try a mixture of mild dish soap and water. For more difficult stains, like pet accidents, consider using an enzymatic cleaner specifically designed for rugs. Always test any cleaning solution on an inconspicuous area of the rug first.  If you've tried everything and the stain persists, you might consider contacting Ruggable customer support for advice.
