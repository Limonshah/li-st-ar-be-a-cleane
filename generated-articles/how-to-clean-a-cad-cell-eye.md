## Keeping Your Pool Sparkling: How To Clean A Cad Cell Eye

Is your saltwater pool not performing as well as it used to? A dirty CAD (Current Adaptive Detection) cell eye could be the culprit. The CAD cell eye is a crucial component of your salt chlorine generator, monitoring the water’s flow and preventing damage. Keeping it clean ensures accurate readings and efficient chlorine production. This article will guide you through the process of cleaning your CAD cell eye, helping you maintain a healthy and sparkling pool. We’ll cover everything from identifying a dirty cell eye to the best cleaning methods and preventative measures.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly inspect your CAD cell eye for buildup.
*   Turn off the power before cleaning.
*   Use a soft brush and mild solution for gentle cleaning.
*   Rinse thoroughly and reinstall carefully.

**What is a CAD Cell Eye and Why Clean It?**

The CAD cell eye is a small sensor located near the salt cell. It detects the flow of water through the cell. If the flow stops or slows significantly, the CAD cell eye signals the system to shut down, preventing the salt cell from overheating and failing. Over time, calcium deposits, scale, and other debris can accumulate on the CAD cell eye, obstructing its view and causing false readings. This can lead to the system shutting down unnecessarily or, worse, allowing the salt cell to operate without adequate flow, potentially damaging it. Regular cleaning ensures accurate flow detection and prolongs the life of your salt chlorine generator.

### Identifying a Dirty Cad Cell Eye

Before you start cleaning, you need to know what to look for. A dirty CAD cell eye often presents with a few telltale signs. First, you might notice your salt chlorine generator is frequently shutting down, even when the water flow seems normal. This is a common indicator. Second, visually inspect the cell eye itself. Look for a white, cloudy film or visible scale buildup on the sensor lens. This buildup obstructs the sensor’s ability to accurately detect water flow. Finally, check your pool’s control panel for error messages related to low flow or CAD cell malfunction. If you see these signs, it’s time to clean the CAD cell eye.

### Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Cleaning a CAD cell eye doesn’t require a lot of specialized equipment. You likely have most of what you need already. Here’s a list of supplies:

*   **Soft-bristled brush:** A toothbrush or small nylon brush works well.
*   **Mild cleaning solution:** White vinegar diluted with water (1:1 ratio) is a safe and effective option. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners.
*   **Clean water:** For rinsing.
*   **Gloves (optional):** To protect your hands.
*   **Screwdriver (if needed):** Some CAD cell eyes are removable and may require a screwdriver.

Having these supplies ready will make the cleaning process quick and efficient. Remember, gentle cleaning is key to avoid damaging the sensitive sensor.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Your Cad Cell Eye

Now, let's get to the cleaning process. First and foremost, **turn off the power to your salt chlorine generator at the breaker**. Safety is paramount. Next, locate the CAD cell eye. It’s usually a small, circular or rectangular sensor near the salt cell. If your CAD cell eye is removable, carefully detach it using a screwdriver if necessary. Now, dip your soft-bristled brush into the diluted vinegar solution and gently scrub the sensor lens. Avoid applying excessive pressure. Focus on removing the visible buildup. Once you’ve scrubbed the lens, rinse it thoroughly with clean water. Ensure all traces of vinegar are removed. If the cell eye is removable, allow it to air dry completely before reinstalling it. Finally, carefully reinstall the CAD cell eye and restore power to your salt chlorine generator.

### Preventing Future Buildup on the Cad Cell Eye

Cleaning your CAD cell eye is important, but preventing buildup in the first place is even better. Maintaining proper water chemistry is the first step. Keep your pool’s calcium hardness, alkalinity, and pH levels balanced. This will minimize scale formation. Regularly check and adjust your water chemistry as needed. Consider using a scale inhibitor, which can help prevent calcium deposits from forming on the CAD cell eye and other pool equipment. You can find these products at most pool supply stores. Finally, periodically inspect the CAD cell eye for early signs of buildup and address them before they become a major problem.

### Troubleshooting Common Cad Cell Eye Issues

Even after cleaning, you might encounter some issues. If your salt chlorine generator continues to shut down, double-check that the CAD cell eye is clean and properly installed. Ensure there are no obstructions in the water flow path leading to the salt cell. Sometimes, a clogged filter or a closed valve can restrict flow and trigger a false reading. If the problem persists, the CAD cell eye itself may be faulty and require replacement. Consult your salt chlorine generator’s manual or contact a qualified pool technician for assistance.

### When to Call a Professional

While cleaning a CAD cell eye is a relatively simple DIY task, there are times when it’s best to call a professional. If you’re uncomfortable working with electrical components, don’t attempt to clean the CAD cell eye yourself. If you’ve cleaned the cell eye and the problem persists, a more serious issue may be present. A qualified pool technician can diagnose the problem accurately and recommend the appropriate solution. They can also safely replace the CAD cell eye if necessary. Don't hesitate to seek professional help if you're unsure about any aspect of the cleaning or troubleshooting process.



## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How often should I clean my CAD cell eye?**

A: It depends on your water chemistry and usage, but generally, inspect it monthly and clean it as needed. If you notice frequent shutdowns or visible buildup, clean it immediately.

**Q: Can I use bleach to clean my CAD cell eye?**

A: No, avoid using bleach or harsh chemicals. They can damage the sensor. Diluted white vinegar is a much safer and effective option.

**Q: What if my CAD cell eye is difficult to remove?**

A: Don’t force it. Apply gentle pressure and use the correct screwdriver if necessary. If it’s still stuck, consult your salt chlorine generator’s manual or a professional.

**Q: Will cleaning the CAD cell eye improve my pool’s chlorine production?**

A: Yes, a clean CAD cell eye ensures accurate flow detection, allowing the salt chlorine generator to operate efficiently and produce the correct amount of chlorine.

## Conclusion

Cleaning your CAD cell eye is a simple yet crucial step in maintaining a healthy and efficient saltwater pool. By regularly inspecting and cleaning this vital component, you can prevent unnecessary shutdowns, prolong the life of your salt chlorine generator, and enjoy a sparkling clean pool all season long. Remember to always prioritize safety by turning off the power before cleaning and using gentle cleaning methods. If you encounter any difficulties, don’t hesitate to consult a professional. Keeping your CAD cell eye clean is a small effort that yields significant rewards.
