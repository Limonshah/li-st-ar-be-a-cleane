Many home cooks shy away from preparing these crustaceans, thinking it’s too difficult. This guide will walk you through exactly [how to clean crab](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-crab), specifically soft shell crabs, making it a surprisingly simple task. We’ll cover everything from preparation to the final rinse, ensuring you can enjoy this delicacy with confidence. Let's dive in and unlock the secrets to perfectly cleaned soft shell crab.

**Quick Answer:**

Cleaning soft shell crab involves removing the gills, apron, and any internal organs. This is done by lifting the shell and gently scraping away unwanted parts, followed by a thorough rinse under cold water. It’s a quick process that unlocks the delicious flavor within!

## Understanding Soft Shell Crab & Preparation

Soft shell crabs aren’t a different *type* of crab; they’re crabs – usually blue crabs – that have recently molted their hard shells. This means they’re incredibly vulnerable, and therefore, need to be handled with care.  The new shell is soft and pliable, allowing for the entire crab to be cooked and eaten. Before you even begin cleaning, ensure your crabs are alive and active.  A sluggish or unresponsive crab should not be consumed. 

To prepare, gently rinse the crabs under cold water to remove any debris.  Have a cutting board and a small, sturdy knife ready.  You’ll also want a bowl for discarding the unwanted parts.  Remember, speed is key, as the crabs are delicate and best cooked immediately after cleaning.

## Removing the Apron

The apron is the flap on the underside of the crab. It’s not harmful to eat, but many people prefer to remove it.  To do this, gently lift the apron with your fingers. It’s usually fairly easy to grasp.  Then, using the tip of your knife, carefully pry it away from the crab’s body.  A slight tug should be all it takes.  Discard the apron in your designated bowl. This step is straightforward and makes the crab look cleaner and more appealing.

## Cleaning the Gills and Internal Organs

This is the most important part of cleaning a soft shell crab.  Lift the shell, starting from the rear of the crab.  You’ll see feathery gills and a grayish-brown mass of internal organs.  Using the tip of your knife or your fingers, gently scrape away the gills and the internal organs.  Be thorough, but avoid damaging the crab’s body.  

Don’t worry about getting *every* tiny bit; a good rinse will take care of the rest.  Focus on removing the bulk of the gills and the central mass.  This process is similar to cleaning [Dungeness crab](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-dungeness-crab), but requires a gentler touch due to the soft shell.

## Rinsing and Inspecting the Crab

Once you’ve removed the gills and internal organs, it’s time to rinse the crab thoroughly under cold running water.  Gently move the legs and body to ensure all debris is washed away.  Inspect the crab carefully to make sure you haven’t missed any remnants of the gills or internal organs.  

Pay close attention to the crevices around the legs and the underside of the shell.  A clean crab will have a slightly pinkish or creamy color inside.  If you notice any discoloration or unusual odors, it’s best to discard the crab.  Proper rinsing is crucial for a clean and flavorful final product.

## Dealing with the "Mustard" (Optional)

Some people enjoy the “mustard,” which is the hepatopancreas of the crab – essentially its liver and pancreas. It’s a greenish-yellow substance.  It’s perfectly safe to eat and has a unique, slightly sweet flavor. However, others prefer to remove it.  

If you choose to remove it, simply scrape it away with the tip of your knife during the gill and organ removal process.  There’s no right or wrong answer here; it’s a matter of personal preference.  If you're unsure, you can always try a small amount to see if you like it.

## Preparing for Cooking: Drying and Seasoning

After rinsing, gently pat the soft shell crabs dry with paper towels. This helps them crisp up nicely when cooked.  Now is the time to season them!  A simple mixture of salt, pepper, and paprika works well.  You can also add garlic powder, onion powder, or Old Bay seasoning for extra flavor. 

Ensure the seasoning is evenly distributed over the entire crab.  For a light coating, simply sprinkle the seasoning on. For a more substantial coating, dredge the crabs in seasoned flour or cornmeal.  Now your soft shell crabs are ready for frying, baking, or steaming!  Consider pairing your cooked crab with a side of [how to clean a sink](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-sink) to wash your hands after handling the crabs.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can I clean soft shell crabs ahead of time?**

A: It’s best to clean and cook soft shell crabs immediately after purchase. They are very delicate and don’t store well once cleaned. If you must, you can keep them refrigerated for a very short period (up to an hour) on a bed of ice, but quality will decline.

**Q: What if the crab is already dead when I get it?**

A:  Avoid consuming a crab that was already dead when you purchased it. Freshness is crucial for both flavor and safety.

**Q: Is it difficult to remove all the gills?**

A: It can be a little tricky at first, but with practice, it becomes easier. Focus on gently scraping them away without damaging the crab’s body. A thorough rinse will remove any remaining bits.

**Q: What’s the best way to cook cleaned soft shell crabs?**

A: Frying is the most popular method, resulting in a crispy, golden-brown crab. Baking and steaming are also good options, offering a healthier alternative.

**Q: Are soft shell crabs high in cholesterol?**

A: Like most seafood, soft shell crabs contain cholesterol. However, they are also a good source of protein and other essential nutrients. Enjoy in moderation as part of a balanced diet.
