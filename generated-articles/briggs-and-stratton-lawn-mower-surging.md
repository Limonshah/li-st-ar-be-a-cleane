## Briggs And Stratton Lawn Mower Surging: A Comprehensive Guide

Have you noticed your Briggs & Stratton lawn mower speeding up and slowing down erratically while mowing? This frustrating issue, known as surging, can ruin your lawn care experience. A surging engine isn’t just annoying; it indicates an underlying problem that needs addressing. This article will walk you through the most common causes of a Briggs & Stratton lawn mower surging, and provide you with practical solutions to get your mower back to its best. We’ll cover everything from simple fixes to more involved repairs, ensuring you can tackle this issue with confidence.

**Takeaway:**

*   Clean or replace the air filter.
*   Inspect and clean the carburetor.
*   Check the fuel lines and fuel filter for obstructions.
*   Ensure the governor linkage is functioning correctly.

A Briggs & Stratton lawn mower surging means the engine speed is fluctuating up and down instead of maintaining a consistent RPM. This often happens because the engine isn’t getting a consistent supply of air or fuel. Identifying the root cause is key to a successful repair, and we’ll help you do just that.

## 1. Dirty Air Filter: A Common Culprit

A clogged air filter is one of the most frequent causes of a surging Briggs & Stratton engine. The air filter’s job is to keep dust and debris out of the engine, but when it gets too dirty, it restricts airflow. This restricted airflow disrupts the air-fuel mixture, leading to surging.  Think of it like trying to breathe through a stuffy nose – it’s hard to get a consistent breath!

To check your air filter, simply remove it from the housing. If it’s visibly dirty, you can try cleaning it by gently tapping it to remove loose debris. However, for heavily soiled filters, replacement is the best option.  A clean air filter ensures proper airflow and a smooth-running engine. You can find replacement filters at most hardware stores or online.

## 2. Carburetor Issues: Fuel Delivery Problems

The carburetor is responsible for mixing air and fuel in the correct proportions. If the carburetor is dirty or malfunctioning, it can cause a lean fuel mixture, resulting in surging.  A lean mixture means there isn’t enough fuel for the amount of air, causing the engine to run erratically.  Debris can build up in the carburetor jets and passages, restricting fuel flow.

Cleaning the carburetor is often the solution. You can use a carburetor cleaner spray and carefully disassemble the carburetor to clean each part. If you're not comfortable disassembling the carburetor, consider taking it to a qualified mechanic.  Alternatively, you can learn [how to clean a Briggs and Stratton carburetor](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-briggs-and-stratton-carburetor) for a step-by-step guide.  Sometimes, a complete carburetor rebuild kit is the most effective solution, especially for older mowers.

## 3. Fuel System Obstructions: Blocked Fuel Flow

Beyond the carburetor, other parts of the fuel system can contribute to surging. A clogged fuel line or a dirty fuel filter can restrict fuel flow to the carburetor. This restriction creates an inconsistent fuel supply, leading to the engine surging.  It’s like trying to drink through a very narrow straw – it’s difficult to get enough liquid quickly.

Inspect the fuel lines for kinks or cracks. Replace any damaged lines.  The fuel filter should also be checked and replaced if it’s dirty.  You can usually find the fuel filter in the fuel line between the fuel tank and the carburetor.  Regularly cleaning the [gas tank on your lawn mower](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-gas-tank-on-lawn-mower) can also prevent debris from entering the fuel system.

## 4. Governor Linkage Problems: Speed Regulation Issues

The governor regulates engine speed by adjusting the throttle. If the governor linkage is loose, bent, or sticking, it can cause the engine to surge. The governor tries to maintain a consistent speed, but if the linkage isn’t working correctly, it can’t do its job effectively.  This results in the engine speeding up and slowing down uncontrollably.

Inspect the governor linkage for any signs of damage or looseness.  Make sure the linkage moves freely without binding.  If you find any issues, tighten any loose connections or replace damaged parts.  If you suspect a more complex governor issue, it’s best to consult a mechanic.  A malfunctioning governor can also be a sign of a larger engine problem.

## 5. Old or Stale Fuel: Fuel Degradation

Old or stale fuel can cause a variety of engine problems, including surging. As fuel ages, it loses its volatility and can form gum and varnish deposits. These deposits can clog the carburetor jets and fuel lines, restricting fuel flow.  Using fresh fuel is crucial for optimal engine performance.

Drain the old fuel from the fuel tank and replace it with fresh fuel. It’s also a good idea to add a fuel stabilizer to the fuel tank to prevent fuel from going stale.  Fuel stabilizer helps to keep the fuel fresh for longer periods, especially during storage.  If you've recently run out of gas and are experiencing surging, you might need to [clean the carburetor after running out of gas](https://beacleaner.com/lawn-mower-wont-start-after-running-out-of-gas-quick-fixes).

## 6. Spark Plug Issues: Incomplete Combustion

While less common, a faulty spark plug can also contribute to a surging engine. A worn or fouled spark plug can cause incomplete combustion, leading to erratic engine performance.  Incomplete combustion means the fuel isn’t burning efficiently, resulting in a loss of power and surging.

Inspect the spark plug for signs of wear or fouling. Clean the spark plug with a wire brush or replace it if necessary.  Ensure the spark plug gap is set to the manufacturer’s specifications.  A properly functioning spark plug is essential for efficient combustion and a smooth-running engine.

## FAQ: Addressing Your Surging Concerns

**Q: Can a dirty fuel filter cause my Briggs & Stratton lawn mower to surge?**

A: Yes, a clogged fuel filter restricts fuel flow to the carburetor, creating an inconsistent fuel supply. This can definitely cause the engine to surge. Replacing the fuel filter is a simple and inexpensive fix.

**Q: How often should I clean the carburetor on my lawn mower?**

A: It depends on how often you use your lawn mower and the conditions you mow in. Generally, cleaning the carburetor annually or after every 50-100 hours of use is a good practice.

**Q: What does it mean if my lawn mower surges only when it's hot?**

A: Surging when hot could indicate a heat-related issue with the carburetor or governor.  The heat may be causing parts to expand and bind, disrupting fuel flow or governor function.

**Q: Is it safe to use fuel stabilizer in my lawn mower?**

A: Yes, fuel stabilizer is highly recommended, especially if you don't use your lawn mower frequently. It prevents fuel from degrading and forming gum and varnish deposits.



## Conclusion: Get Back to Smooth Mowing

A surging Briggs & Stratton lawn mower can be a frustrating problem, but it’s often a fixable one. By systematically checking the air filter, carburetor, fuel system, governor linkage, and spark plug, you can identify the cause of the surging and restore your mower to its optimal performance. Remember to use fresh fuel and consider a fuel stabilizer to prevent future issues. If you’re uncomfortable performing any of these repairs yourself, don’t hesitate to consult a qualified mechanic.  With a little effort, you can get back to enjoying a smooth and efficient mowing experience. Don't let a surging engine ruin your lawn care routine – take action today!
