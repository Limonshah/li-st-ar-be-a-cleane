## Keeping the Heat On: How To Clean A Sauna Suit

Have you invested in a sauna suit to boost your workouts and maximize sweat? A clean sauna suit is crucial for both hygiene and performance.  It’s easy for bacteria to build up, leading to odors and potential skin irritation. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about cleaning your sauna suit, ensuring it stays fresh, effective, and lasts longer. We’ll cover materials, washing methods, drying tips, and even how to tackle stubborn smells.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning prevents odor and bacteria buildup.
*   Hand washing is generally preferred to machine washing.
*   Air drying is best to maintain the suit’s integrity.
*   Proper storage extends the life of your sauna suit.

**Quick Answer:** To clean a sauna suit, hand wash it in cool water with a mild detergent, rinse thoroughly, and air dry. Avoid harsh chemicals, high heat, and machine drying to preserve the material and its sweat-enhancing properties.

## Understanding Your Sauna Suit Material

Before diving into cleaning, it’s important to know what your sauna suit is made of. Most are constructed from materials like PVC, neoprene, or a combination of polyester and polyurethane.  Knowing the material dictates the best cleaning approach.  Different materials react differently to detergents and temperatures. 

*   **PVC Suits:** These are often the most affordable and require gentle handling. Harsh chemicals can cause cracking.
*   **Neoprene Suits:**  Neoprene is more durable but can retain odors.  Special neoprene-specific cleaners are available.
*   **Polyester/Polyurethane Blends:** These offer a balance of flexibility and durability and are generally easier to clean.

Always check the care label on your sauna suit for specific instructions from the manufacturer. If you're unsure, it's always best to err on the side of caution and use a gentle cleaning method.  Taking care of your suit now will save you money in the long run.

## The Best Way to Wash a Sauna Suit: Hand Washing

Hand washing is the most recommended method for cleaning a sauna suit. It’s gentler on the material and helps prevent damage.  Machine washing, even on a delicate cycle, can be too harsh. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Prepare the Wash Basin:** Fill a clean sink or basin with cool water. Avoid hot water, as it can damage the material.
2.  **Add Mild Detergent:** Add a small amount of mild detergent – think baby shampoo or a detergent specifically designed for delicate fabrics. Avoid bleach or fabric softeners.
3.  **Submerge and Soak:** Turn the sauna suit inside out and submerge it in the soapy water. Gently agitate the water to distribute the detergent. Let it soak for 10-15 minutes.
4.  **Gentle Scrubbing:** Use your hands to gently scrub any areas with visible dirt or sweat buildup. Avoid harsh scrubbing, which can damage the material.
5.  **Thorough Rinse:** Rinse the sauna suit thoroughly under cool, running water until all traces of detergent are gone.  Residual detergent can cause irritation.

## Machine Washing (If Allowed) – Proceed with Caution

Some sauna suits *may* be machine washable, but only if the care label specifically allows it. If you choose to machine wash, follow these guidelines:

*   **Use a Laundry Bag:** Place the sauna suit inside a mesh laundry bag to protect it from snagging or tearing.
*   **Delicate Cycle:** Select the delicate or hand-wash cycle on your washing machine.
*   **Cool Water:** Use cool water only.
*   **Mild Detergent:** Use a small amount of mild detergent.
*   **Skip the Spin Cycle:**  Avoid the spin cycle, as it can be too aggressive.

Even with these precautions, machine washing carries a higher risk of damage than hand washing.  If you're hesitant, stick to hand washing.

## Drying Your Sauna Suit Properly

Proper drying is just as important as washing. Heat is the enemy of most sauna suit materials.  Here’s how to dry your sauna suit correctly:

*   **Avoid Direct Sunlight:**  Direct sunlight can fade the color and degrade the material.
*   **Air Dry Only:**  Hang the sauna suit on a clothesline or lay it flat on a clean, dry surface to air dry.
*   **Turn Inside Out:**  Dry the suit inside out to allow the inner layers to dry thoroughly.
*   **No Dryer!:**  Never put your sauna suit in the dryer. The heat will likely cause it to shrink, crack, or otherwise become damaged.

Allow ample time for the suit to dry completely before storing it.  Moisture can lead to mildew and unpleasant odors.

## Tackling Stubborn Odors and Stains

Even with regular cleaning, sauna suits can sometimes develop stubborn odors or stains. Here are a few tips for tackling these issues:

*   **Vinegar Soak:** For odors, soak the suit in a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar for 30 minutes before washing.
*   **Baking Soda Paste:** For stains, make a paste of baking soda and water and gently apply it to the stain. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes before rinsing.
*   **Neoprene Cleaner:** If you have a neoprene suit, consider using a neoprene-specific cleaner to remove odors and stains.
*   **Disinfectant Spray:** A light mist of disinfectant spray (ensure it's fabric-safe) can help kill bacteria and reduce odors.

If the odor or stain persists, it may be time to replace the sauna suit.  A heavily soiled suit may not be hygienic to use.

## Storing Your Sauna Suit for Longevity

Proper storage can significantly extend the life of your sauna suit. Here’s how to store it correctly:

*   **Clean and Dry:** Ensure the suit is completely clean and dry before storing it.
*   **Cool, Dry Place:** Store the suit in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat.
*   **Hanging vs. Folding:**  Hanging is generally preferred to avoid creases. If folding, do so loosely.
*   **Avoid Compression:**  Don’t store the suit in a tightly compressed space, as this can damage the material.
