## Craftsman Lawn Mower Back Wheels Won't Turn: A Complete Guide

Have you been frustrated trying to mow your lawn only to find your Craftsman lawn mower’s back wheels simply won’t turn? This is a common issue, and thankfully, often a fix you can tackle yourself.  We’ll walk through the most likely causes and provide clear, step-by-step instructions to get your mower rolling again. This article will focus on diagnosing and repairing why your Craftsman mower’s rear wheels aren’t engaging, so you can get back to enjoying a perfectly manicured lawn. Let's dive in and get those wheels turning!

**Takeaway:**

*   Check the drive belt for wear or breakage.
*   Inspect the wheel hubs and axles for damage.
*   Ensure the drive cables are properly connected and adjusted.
*   Consider a clogged or malfunctioning transmission.

**Quick Answer:**

If your Craftsman lawn mower’s back wheels won’t turn, the most common culprits are a broken or slipped drive belt, a damaged wheel hub, or an issue with the drive cables connecting the levers to the transmission.  A thorough inspection of these components is the first step to getting your mower working again.

## 1. Understanding Your Craftsman Mower’s Drive System

Before we start troubleshooting, it’s helpful to understand how your Craftsman lawn mower’s drive system works. Most Craftsman mowers utilize a belt-driven system to transfer power from the engine to the rear wheels. When you engage the drive lever, it tightens a cable that activates the transmission, which then engages the belt and turns the wheels.  Understanding this basic setup will help you pinpoint the source of the problem.  A properly functioning system ensures smooth and efficient mowing.  If any part of this system fails, you’ll likely experience the issue of wheels not turning.

## 2. Inspecting the Drive Belt: The Most Common Culprit

The drive belt is often the first place to look when your Craftsman mower’s back wheels won’t turn.  Belts can wear out, crack, or even break over time, especially with regular use.  Start by disengaging the blade and parking brake, then carefully inspect the drive belt for any visible signs of damage. Look for cracks, fraying, or complete breaks.  If the belt is loose or slipping, it won’t effectively transfer power to the wheels. Replacing a worn or broken drive belt is a relatively inexpensive and straightforward repair.  You can find replacement belts specifically designed for your Craftsman model online or at your local hardware store.

## 3. Checking the Wheel Hubs and Axles for Damage

If the drive belt appears to be in good condition, the problem might lie with the wheel hubs or axles.  These components allow the wheels to rotate freely.  Inspect the wheel hubs for any signs of damage, such as cracks or bent metal.  Also, check the axles for straightness and ensure they are securely attached to the mower deck.  A damaged hub or axle can prevent the wheels from turning, even if the belt is functioning correctly.  Sometimes, debris can become lodged in the hub, causing resistance.  Removing any obstructions and ensuring proper lubrication can resolve the issue.

## 4. Examining the Drive Cables and Connections

The drive cables are responsible for transmitting the motion from the drive lever to the transmission.  These cables can become stretched, disconnected, or corroded over time.  Start by visually inspecting the cables for any signs of damage.  Ensure they are securely connected to both the drive lever and the transmission.  If a cable is loose or disconnected, reattach it securely.  If a cable is stretched, it may need to be adjusted or replaced.  Proper cable adjustment is crucial for ensuring the transmission engages correctly.

## 5. Investigating the Transmission System

The transmission is the heart of your mower’s drive system.  If the belt and cables are functioning correctly, the problem might be a clogged or malfunctioning transmission.  Transmission issues can be more complex to diagnose and repair.  Look for any signs of leaks or damage to the transmission housing.  Sometimes, old grass clippings and debris can accumulate inside the transmission, causing it to malfunction.  Cleaning the transmission may resolve the issue, but in some cases, the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.  If you suspect a transmission problem, it’s best to consult a qualified lawn mower repair technician.  Understanding [how to easily disengage hydrostatic transmission on your Craftsman mower](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-easily-disengage-hydrostatic-transmission-on-your-craftsman-mower-2) can be helpful for maintenance.

## 6. Lubrication: A Simple Solution Often Overlooked

Often, a simple lack of lubrication can cause the rear wheels to seize up.  Check the wheel bearings and axles for adequate grease.  Apply a waterproof grease specifically designed for lawn mower components.  This will help reduce friction and ensure smooth wheel rotation.  Regular lubrication is a preventative measure that can help avoid future problems.  Don't underestimate the power of a well-lubricated machine!  Remember to disconnect the spark plug before performing any maintenance to prevent accidental starting.

## 7.  Addressing Potential Hydrostatic Transmission Issues (Riding Mowers)

If you have a Craftsman riding mower, the issue could stem from the hydrostatic transmission. These systems use hydraulic fluid to power the wheels. Low fluid levels or contaminated fluid can cause the wheels to not turn. Check the fluid level and condition. If it's low, top it off with the correct type of fluid (refer to your owner's manual). If it's dirty, a fluid flush might be necessary.  A failing hydrostatic pump can also cause this issue, but that's a more complex repair.
