## Keeping Your Reefs Looking New: A Cleaning Guide

Are your beloved Reef flip flops looking a little worse for wear? Don't worry, it happens! These sandals are designed for fun in the sun, and that means they’re bound to pick up dirt, sand, and grime along the way. Fortunately, cleaning your Reef flip flops is a simple process that can restore them to their former glory. This article will walk you through everything you need to know to keep your Reefs clean, comfortable, and ready for your next adventure. We’ll cover everything from quick rinses to deeper cleaning methods, ensuring your favorite footwear lasts longer.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular rinsing removes loose debris.
*   Mild soap and water are effective for general cleaning.
*   A soft brush helps tackle stubborn dirt.
*   Proper drying prevents mildew and odors.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean Reef flip flops, simply rinse them with water to remove loose dirt. Then, use a mild soap like dish soap, scrub gently with a soft brush, and rinse thoroughly. Allow them to air dry completely, avoiding direct sunlight.

## Understanding Your Reef Flip Flops’ Material

Before diving into cleaning, it’s important to understand what your Reef flip flops are made of. Most Reefs feature an EVA foam footbed and a rubber sole. Knowing this helps you choose the right cleaning methods. EVA foam is relatively durable but can be damaged by harsh chemicals or excessive heat. The rubber sole is more resilient but can still benefit from gentle cleaning. Different Reef styles may incorporate additional materials like leather or fabric, so always check the manufacturer’s recommendations if available.

## The Daily Rinse: Preventing Build-Up

The easiest way to keep your Reef flip flops clean is to rinse them after each use. This prevents dirt and salt from building up and causing damage. Simply hold them under running water, focusing on the footbed and the areas where the straps connect to the sole. A quick rinse takes only a few seconds and can significantly extend the life of your sandals. This simple habit will minimize the need for more intensive cleaning later on. Consider this your first line of defense against grime!

## Deep Cleaning with Soap and Water

For a more thorough cleaning, you’ll need mild soap and water. Dish soap works perfectly, as it’s designed to cut through grease and dirt without being too harsh. Fill a basin or sink with lukewarm water and add a small amount of dish soap. Submerge your Reef flip flops and gently scrub them with a soft brush, paying attention to the footbed, straps, and sole. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or brushes, as these can damage the materials. Rinse thoroughly with clean water to remove all traces of soap.

### Tackling Stubborn Dirt and Stains

Sometimes, a simple soap and water wash isn’t enough. For stubborn dirt or stains, you can try a slightly more targeted approach. Create a paste of baking soda and water and apply it to the affected area. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes, then scrub gently with a soft brush. Baking soda is a natural abrasive that can help lift dirt without damaging the materials. For particularly tough stains, you might consider a specialized shoe cleaner, but always test it on a small, inconspicuous area first.

## Drying Your Reef Flip Flops Properly

Proper drying is crucial to prevent mildew and odors. Avoid drying your Reef flip flops in direct sunlight or near a heat source, as this can cause the EVA foam to crack or warp. Instead, allow them to air dry in a well-ventilated area. You can stuff them with paper towels to help absorb excess moisture and maintain their shape. Ensure they are completely dry before storing them to prevent the growth of mold or bacteria. [If your flip flops smell, check out this guide](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-flip-flops-smell).

## Cleaning Different Reef Styles

Reef offers a variety of flip flop styles, and some may require slightly different cleaning approaches. For example, Reef leather flip flops will need special care to avoid drying out the leather. Use a leather cleaner and conditioner specifically designed for footwear. For styles with fabric straps, you may be able to hand wash them gently or even machine wash them on a delicate cycle (inside a laundry bag). Always check the manufacturer’s instructions for specific care recommendations. [Cleaning leather flip flops requires a different approach](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-leather-flip-flops).

## Maintaining Your Reefs: Preventative Measures

Beyond regular cleaning, there are several things you can do to maintain your Reef flip flops and keep them looking their best. Avoid wearing them in harsh environments where they might be exposed to chemicals or extreme temperatures. Store them in a cool, dry place when not in use. Consider using a flip flop rack or organizer to keep them off the floor and prevent them from getting crushed. With a little care and attention, your Reef flip flops will provide you with years of comfortable wear.



## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I put my Reef flip flops in the washing machine?**

A: While some Reef styles *might* be machine washable on a delicate cycle (inside a laundry bag), it’s generally not recommended. The heat and agitation can damage the EVA foam and other materials. Hand washing is always the safest option.

**Q: How do I remove scuff marks from the rubber sole?**

A: A magic eraser or a paste of baking soda and water can often remove scuff marks from the rubber sole. Gently rub the affected area and rinse thoroughly.

**Q: What’s the best way to clean the straps of my Reef flip flops?**

A: Use a mild soap and water solution and a soft brush to clean the straps. For fabric straps, you may be able to hand wash them separately.

**Q: How often should I clean my Reef flip flops?**

A: It depends on how often you wear them and the conditions you wear them in. A quick rinse after each use is ideal, and a deep cleaning every few weeks or months should suffice.

**Q: Can I use bleach to clean my Reef flip flops?**

A: No, absolutely not! Bleach can damage the materials and discolor your flip flops. Stick to mild soap and water.
