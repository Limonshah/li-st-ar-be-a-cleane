Have you ever noticed green or black stains creeping across your home’s siding or brick? This common sight is often algae, a simple plant-like organism. Algae thrives in damp, shaded environments. Your home's exterior provides an ideal place for it to grow. Areas that stay wet after rain or receive little direct sunlight are prime targets.

Algae not only makes your house look dirty, but it can also trap moisture. This trapped moisture can lead to other issues. It creates a breeding ground for mold and mildew.
