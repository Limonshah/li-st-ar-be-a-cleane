## How to Wash a Perm: Keep Those Curls Bouncing!

Have you just gotten a perm and are now wondering about the best way to care for it? Washing a perm is different than washing naturally straight hair, or even naturally curly hair. It requires a gentle approach and specific products to maintain the curl pattern and prevent damage. This article will guide you through everything you need to know about washing your perm, from choosing the right shampoo and conditioner to drying techniques that will keep your curls looking their best. We’ll cover how often to wash, what ingredients to avoid, and how to combat frizz. 

**Takeaway:**

*   Use sulfate-free shampoo and a hydrating conditioner.
*   Wash your perm less frequently to retain moisture.
*   Apply a leave-in conditioner and curl-defining product.
*   Avoid harsh rubbing with a towel; blot instead.

**Quick Answer:** To wash a perm effectively, use a sulfate-free shampoo and a deeply hydrating conditioner. Wash your hair only 2-3 times a week, gently detangle while conditioning, and avoid harsh rubbing when drying. This will help maintain the curl pattern and prevent damage.

## Understanding Your Perm & Wash Frequency

Perms chemically alter your hair’s structure to create curls. This process can be drying, so maintaining moisture is key. Unlike straight hair, which can handle daily washing, permed hair thrives on less frequent washes. Over-washing strips the hair of its natural oils, leading to dryness, frizz, and a loss of curl definition. Generally, aim to wash your permed hair 2-3 times a week. 

Consider your hair type and lifestyle when determining your wash schedule. If you have a naturally oily scalp, you might need to wash slightly more often. If you’re very active and sweat a lot, you may also need to adjust.  Listening to your hair is crucial – if it feels dry and brittle, reduce your washing frequency.

## Choosing the Right Shampoo for a Perm

The shampoo you choose can make or break your perm. Traditional shampoos often contain sulfates, harsh detergents that strip the hair of its natural oils. For permed hair, you *must* opt for a sulfate-free shampoo. These gentler formulas cleanse the hair without causing excessive dryness. Look for shampoos specifically designed for curly hair or permed hair, as these often contain moisturizing ingredients like argan oil, shea butter, or aloe vera. 

Avoid shampoos with alcohol, as this can also be incredibly drying.  Read the ingredient list carefully!  A good rule of thumb is if you don’t recognize an ingredient, it’s best to avoid it.  You can also find shampoos that offer protein to help strengthen the hair, which is beneficial after the chemical process of a perm.

## Conditioning is Crucial: Hydrating Your Perm

Conditioner is your best friend when it comes to permed hair. After shampooing, apply a generous amount of a deeply hydrating conditioner, focusing on the mid-lengths and ends of your hair. Detangle your hair *while* the conditioner is in, using a wide-tooth comb or your fingers. This minimizes breakage and helps distribute the conditioner evenly. 

Leave the conditioner on for at least 5-10 minutes to allow it to penetrate the hair shaft. For an extra boost of hydration, consider using a deep conditioner or hair mask once a week. Look for ingredients like glycerin, hyaluronic acid, or coconut oil.  Rinsing should be done with cool water to help seal the cuticle and lock in moisture.

## Drying Your Perm: Avoiding Frizz & Damage

How you dry your permed hair is just as important as how you wash it.  Harsh rubbing with a towel can disrupt the curl pattern and cause frizz. Instead, gently blot your hair dry with a microfiber towel or an old t-shirt. Microfiber is much gentler on the hair than traditional terrycloth. 

Avoid using a hairdryer on high heat, as this can damage the hair. If you must use a hairdryer, use a diffuser attachment on a low heat setting. A diffuser helps distribute the heat evenly and prevents the curls from being blown out of shape.  Air drying is always the best option, but it can take a long time.  You can also try "plopping" – wrapping your hair in a microfiber towel or t-shirt to encourage curl formation while it dries.

## Styling Products for Permed Hair

Once your hair is dry, it's time to style!  Choose styling products specifically designed for curly hair. These products help define the curls, control frizz, and add shine.  Leave-in conditioners are a must-have for permed hair, as they provide ongoing hydration. 

Curl creams, gels, and mousses can help enhance the curl pattern and provide hold. Experiment with different products to find what works best for your hair type. Avoid products that contain alcohol or silicones, as these can be drying or build up on the hair.  Applying products to damp hair generally yields the best results.

## Protecting Your Perm Overnight

Protecting your perm while you sleep is essential for maintaining its health and shape. Sleeping on a cotton pillowcase can cause friction, leading to frizz and breakage. Switch to a silk or satin pillowcase, which is much gentler on the hair. 

You can also try "pineapple-ing" your hair – gathering it loosely on top of your head in a high ponytail or bun. This helps prevent the curls from being crushed while you sleep.  Consider using a silk or satin bonnet or scarf to further protect your hair.
