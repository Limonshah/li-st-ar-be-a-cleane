## How To Clean Your Lace Frontal: A Step-by-Step Guide

Is your lace frontal looking a little dull or collecting product buildup? Keeping your lace frontal clean is crucial for maintaining its appearance and extending its lifespan. A clean lace frontal not only looks better but also promotes a healthier scalp if you’re wearing it directly on your head. This article will walk you through everything you need to know about cleaning your lace frontal, from gathering supplies to drying it properly. 

**Takeaway:**

*   Gently remove buildup with a mild shampoo.
*   Focus on the lace, avoiding harsh scrubbing.
*   Rinse thoroughly and allow to air dry.
*   Store properly to prevent damage.

**Quick Answer:** To clean a lace frontal, gently wash it with a mild, sulfate-free shampoo, focusing on the hairline and lace. Rinse thoroughly with cool water and allow it to air dry on a wig stand. Avoid harsh chemicals and excessive heat to preserve the lace and hair.

## Understanding Your Lace Frontal & Cleaning Frequency

Before diving into the cleaning process, it’s important to understand what your lace frontal is made of. Most lace frontals are constructed with delicate lace and human or synthetic hair. Knowing this will help you choose the right cleaning products and techniques. Generally, you should aim to clean your lace frontal every 6-8 wears, or more frequently if you use a lot of styling products. 

Regular cleaning prevents buildup from oils, sweat, and products, which can cause the lace to become stiff and the hair to look dull.  Ignoring this can lead to a shorter lifespan for your investment.  Consider your lifestyle and product usage when determining your cleaning schedule.

## Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Having the right supplies on hand will make the cleaning process much smoother. You won’t need a lot, but choosing the correct items is key. Here’s what you’ll need:

*   **Mild, Sulfate-Free Shampoo:** This is essential for gently cleaning the hair without stripping it of its natural oils.
*   **Wide-Tooth Comb or Wig Brush:** For detangling the hair before and after washing.
*   **Soft-Bristled Brush:**  Useful for cleaning the lace itself.
*   **Cool Water:** Hot water can damage the lace and hair.
*   **Clean Towel:** For blotting excess water.
*   **Wig Stand:**  To allow the frontal to air dry properly.
*   **Optional: Lace Tint Spray:** To recolor the lace if needed after cleaning.

Avoid using harsh chemicals, alcohol-based products, or abrasive scrubs, as these can damage the delicate lace and hair.

## The Step-by-Step Cleaning Process

Now, let's get to the actual cleaning! Follow these steps for a thorough and gentle clean.

1.  **Detangle the Hair:** Before wetting the frontal, gently detangle the hair using a wide-tooth comb or wig brush. Start from the ends and work your way up to the roots.
2.  **Prepare the Water:** Fill a basin or sink with cool water.
3.  **Add Shampoo:** Add a small amount of mild, sulfate-free shampoo to the water and gently mix.
4.  **Wash the Frontal:** Submerge the lace frontal in the water and gently swish it around. Focus on cleaning the hairline and lace area, using your fingers or a soft-bristled brush to remove any buildup. Avoid scrubbing vigorously.
5.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse the frontal thoroughly with cool water until all the shampoo is removed.  Ensure no residue remains, as this can cause buildup.
6.  **Blot Dry:** Gently blot the frontal with a clean towel to remove excess water. Do not rub, as this can cause tangling.
7.  **Air Dry:** Place the frontal on a wig stand and allow it to air dry completely. Avoid using a hairdryer, as the heat can damage the lace and hair.

## Dealing with Stubborn Stains & Buildup

Sometimes, gentle washing isn’t enough to remove stubborn stains or buildup. Here are a few tips for tackling those tricky spots:

*   **Oil-Based Stains:** For oil-based stains, you can try using a small amount of dish soap diluted in water. Gently apply it to the stain and rinse thoroughly.
*   **Product Buildup:** If you notice a lot of product buildup, you can use a clarifying shampoo specifically designed for wigs. Use it sparingly, as it can be drying.
*   **Lace Discoloration:** If the lace has become discolored, you can try using a lace tint spray to recolor it. Follow the instructions on the product carefully.

Remember to always test any cleaning solution on a small, inconspicuous area of the lace first to ensure it doesn’t cause any damage.

## Proper Storage to Maintain Cleanliness

Cleaning your lace frontal is only half the battle. Proper storage is essential for maintaining its cleanliness and preventing damage. Here’s how to store your lace frontal:

*   **Wig Stand:** Store the frontal on a wig stand to maintain its shape.
*   **Wig Cap:** Cover the frontal with a wig cap to protect it from dust and dirt.
*   **Cool, Dry Place:** Store the frontal in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.
*   **Avoid Plastic Bags:** Avoid storing the frontal in a plastic bag, as this can trap moisture and cause mildew.
