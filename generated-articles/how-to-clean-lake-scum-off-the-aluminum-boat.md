## Cleaning Lake Scum From Your Aluminum Boat: A Step-by-Step Guide

Is your aluminum boat looking a little worse for wear after a day on the lake? That slimy, greenish buildup is commonly called “lake scum,” and it’s a common problem for boat owners. Don't worry, getting rid of it doesn’t have to be a huge chore. This guide will show you how to effectively clean lake scum off your aluminum boat, keeping it looking its best and preventing potential damage. We’ll cover everything from identifying the scum to choosing the right cleaning products and techniques.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning prevents scum buildup.
*   Mild soap and water are often sufficient for light scum.
*   Specialized aluminum cleaners tackle tougher stains.
*   Protect your boat with a sealant after cleaning.

**What Exactly *Is* Lake Scum?**

Lake scum isn’t just one thing; it’s a combination of algae, pollen, dirt, and decaying organic matter. This mixture creates a slimy film that clings to your boat’s surface. Left unchecked, this scum can etch into the aluminum, causing discoloration and potentially weakening the material.  Regular cleaning is the best defense against this.  Let's dive into how to tackle this issue effectively.

## Identifying the Type of Lake Scum on Your Boat

Before you start scrubbing, it’s helpful to understand what you’re dealing with. Light scum appears as a greenish film, easily wiped away. Heavier scum might look darker and feel more substantial, requiring more effort to remove. Knowing the severity will help you choose the right cleaning method.  Sometimes, the scum is mixed with water stains, making it appear even more stubborn.  

*   **Light Scum:** Easily removable with soap and water.
*   **Moderate Scum:** Requires a dedicated boat cleaner or aluminum cleaner.
*   **Heavy Scum:** May need a combination of cleaning methods and some elbow grease.

## Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Having the right tools makes the job much easier. You’ll need a few essential items to effectively clean lake scum from your aluminum boat.  Don't underestimate the power of having everything ready before you begin! Here’s a checklist:

*   Mild soap (dish soap works well)
*   Aluminum boat cleaner (specifically formulated for aluminum)
*   Soft-bristled brush or sponge
*   Bucket
*   Water hose with a spray nozzle
*   Microfiber cloths
*   Boat wax or sealant (for protection)
*   Gloves (to protect your hands)

## The Gentle Approach: Soap and Water Cleaning

For light lake scum, a simple soap and water solution is often all you need. This method is gentle on the aluminum and effective for routine maintenance. Start by rinsing the boat with water to remove loose debris. Then, mix a small amount of mild dish soap with water in a bucket.  Apply the soapy water to the affected areas using a soft brush or sponge, scrubbing gently in circular motions. Finally, rinse thoroughly with clean water and dry with a microfiber cloth.

## Tackling Tougher Scum with Aluminum Boat Cleaners

When soap and water aren’t enough, it’s time to bring out the big guns: an aluminum boat cleaner. These cleaners are specifically formulated to break down stubborn grime and scum without damaging the aluminum. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully. Typically, you’ll spray the cleaner onto the affected areas, let it sit for a few minutes (but don’t let it dry!), and then scrub with a soft-bristled brush. Rinse thoroughly with water and dry with a microfiber cloth.  If you're unsure about the best cleaner for your boat, consider reading our guide on [how to clean an aluminum boat](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-an-aluminum-boat).

### Choosing the Right Aluminum Cleaner

Not all aluminum cleaners are created equal. Look for a pH-neutral cleaner specifically designed for boats. Avoid abrasive cleaners, as they can scratch the aluminum surface.  Read reviews and choose a product that’s known for its effectiveness and safety.  Some cleaners also offer UV protection, which can help prevent future scum buildup.

## Protecting Your Boat: Waxing and Sealing

Once your boat is clean, it’s important to protect it from future scum buildup. Applying a coat of boat wax or sealant will create a barrier that repels water and grime. This makes cleaning easier in the long run and helps preserve the appearance of your boat. Apply the wax or sealant according to the manufacturer’s instructions, typically using a clean microfiber cloth.  Regular waxing is a great preventative measure.

## Preventing Lake Scum Buildup: Proactive Measures

Prevention is always better than cure. Here are a few tips to help prevent lake scum from building up on your aluminum boat:

*   **Rinse after each use:**  A quick rinse with fresh water after each outing can remove a lot of the initial grime.
*   **Cover your boat:** When not in use, cover your boat to protect it from the elements.
*   **Regular cleaning:**  Establish a regular cleaning schedule, even if it’s just a quick washdown.
*   **Dock in a shaded area:**  Sunlight promotes algae growth, so docking in a shaded area can help.
