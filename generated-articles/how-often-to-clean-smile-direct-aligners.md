## The Importance of Clean Aligners for a Healthy Smile

Think about everything your aligners come into contact with throughout the day. They’re in your mouth, exposed to food particles, saliva, and naturally occurring bacteria.  If these aren’t removed regularly, they can build up on the aligner surface. This buildup can lead to staining, unpleasant odors, and even potentially compromise the fit and effectiveness of your aligners.  Plus, bacteria can contribute to gum disease and cavities, undoing all the hard work you’re putting into straightening your teeth.  Keeping your aligners clean is a vital part of your overall oral hygiene routine.

## Daily Cleaning: A Must-Do Routine

Daily cleaning is the cornerstone of aligner care. After removing your aligners to eat, drink (anything other than water!), or brush your teeth, immediately rinse them under cool water. This removes loose debris and prevents it from drying and hardening.  Then, gently brush your aligners with a soft-bristled toothbrush – the same one you *don’t* use on your teeth!  Use a mild soap or a dedicated aligner cleaning tablet and solution. Avoid abrasive toothpastes, as they can scratch the plastic, creating places for bacteria to hide.

### Choosing the Right Cleaning Solution

There are several options for cleaning your aligners. Aligner cleaning tablets are a popular choice because they’re convenient and effective at removing plaque and stains.  You simply dissolve a tablet in water and soak your aligners for the recommended time.  Mild, unscented liquid soap is another option, but be sure to rinse thoroughly to remove all traces of soap.  Avoid harsh chemicals, bleach, or anything with strong dyes, as these can damage the aligners.

## Weekly Deep Cleaning: Going the Extra Mile

While daily cleaning keeps things manageable, a weekly deep clean is essential for removing stubborn buildup and ensuring your aligners are truly hygienic.  You can use a specialized aligner cleaning solution designed for this purpose.  Follow the product instructions carefully, as soaking times and procedures may vary.  This deep cleaning helps eliminate any lingering bacteria and keeps your aligners looking and smelling fresh.  Consider this like a more thorough version of your daily routine.

## What *Not* To Do When Cleaning Your Aligners

Just as important as knowing what *to* do is knowing what *not* to do.  Never use hot water to clean your aligners, as it can warp the plastic.  Avoid abrasive cleaners like toothpaste, baking soda, or harsh chemicals.  Don’t use anything that could scratch the surface of the aligners.  And definitely don’t clean your aligners with your toothbrush – cross-contamination is a real concern!

## Proper Storage: Protecting Your Investment

When you’re not wearing your aligners, proper storage is key.  Always store them in the provided case. This protects them from damage, dust, and bacteria.  Never wrap them in a napkin or leave them lying around, as they can easily get lost or contaminated.  The case also helps maintain their shape and prevents warping.  Regularly clean the aligner case itself with soap and water to prevent bacteria buildup within the case.

## Addressing Common Aligner Cleaning Concerns

Many people experience specific issues with their aligners.  Staining is common, especially if you drink coffee, tea, or red wine.  Regular cleaning and avoiding these beverages while wearing your aligners can help minimize staining.  If your aligners develop an odor, a longer soak in a cleaning solution may be necessary.  If you notice any cracks or damage, contact your Smile Direct provider immediately.
