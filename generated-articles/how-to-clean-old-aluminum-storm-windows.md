Are your old aluminum storm windows looking a little worse for wear? Don't replace them – restore them! Cleaning old aluminum storm windows doesn’t have to be a daunting task. This guide will walk you through the process, helping you bring back their clarity and protect your home. We’ll cover everything from the best cleaning solutions to techniques for tackling stubborn grime, ensuring your windows look their best.

**Takeaway:**

*   Use gentle cleaning solutions to avoid damaging the aluminum.
*   Regular cleaning prevents dirt buildup and extends window life.
*   Proper drying prevents water spots and streaks.
*   Inspect for damage during cleaning and address promptly.

**Quick Answer:** To clean old aluminum storm windows, mix mild dish soap with warm water, gently scrub with a soft cloth or sponge, rinse thoroughly, and dry with a microfiber cloth. Avoid abrasive cleaners that can damage the aluminum finish.

## 1. Assessing the Condition of Your Aluminum Storm Windows

Before you start scrubbing, take a moment to assess the condition of your aluminum storm windows. This initial inspection will help you determine the best cleaning approach. Look for areas with heavy dirt buildup, corrosion, or any physical damage like dents or cracks. Identifying these issues upfront will prevent you from causing further harm during the cleaning process. 

Consider the age of the windows; older windows may have more fragile paint or finishes. If you notice significant corrosion, you might need to consider a specialized aluminum cleaner – you can learn more about cleaning [aluminum](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-aluminum) in general.  Also, check the window operation. Are they easy to open and close? Sticking windows might indicate a need for lubrication after cleaning.

## 2. Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Having the right tools makes cleaning aluminum storm windows much easier. You won't need anything fancy, just a few essential items. Start with a bucket filled with warm water and a mild dish soap. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the aluminum finish. 

Here’s a checklist of what you’ll need:

*   Mild dish soap
*   Warm water
*   Soft cloths or sponges
*   Microfiber cloths for drying
*   Soft-bristled brush (for stubborn dirt)
*   Spray bottle (optional, for cleaning solution)
*   Garden hose with a gentle spray nozzle

You might also want to have a vacuum with a brush attachment on hand to remove loose dirt and debris before you begin washing.

## 3. The Gentle Washing Process: Cleaning Aluminum Frames

The aluminum frames are the core of your storm windows, and require gentle handling. Begin by removing any loose dirt or debris with a soft brush or vacuum. Next, mix your warm water and dish soap solution in the bucket. Dip a soft cloth or sponge into the solution and gently wipe down the aluminum frames. 

Avoid applying excessive pressure, especially if the paint is old or chipped. For stubborn dirt, let the soapy water sit for a few minutes to loosen the grime before wiping.  If you're dealing with particularly dirty frames, consider using a dedicated [aluminum cleaner](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-aluminum-parts) for a deeper clean. Rinse the frames thoroughly with clean water from your garden hose, ensuring all soap residue is removed.

## 4. Tackling the Glass: Streak-Free Cleaning

Cleaning the glass portion of your storm windows is crucial for maximizing light and visibility.  Start by spraying the glass with your soapy water solution or applying it with a clean cloth. Use a soft sponge or cloth to gently wipe the glass, working from top to bottom. 

For streak-free results, use a clean, dry microfiber cloth to wipe the glass immediately after rinsing. Avoid using paper towels, as they can leave behind lint. If you're struggling with stubborn streaks, try adding a small amount of white vinegar to your cleaning solution.

## 5. Dealing with Corrosion on Aluminum Storm Windows

Corrosion is a common issue with older aluminum storm windows, especially in coastal areas. If you notice any corrosion, it's important to address it promptly to prevent further damage. Start by gently scrubbing the corroded areas with a soft-bristled brush and a specialized aluminum corrosion remover. 

Follow the product instructions carefully, and always test the cleaner in an inconspicuous area first. After removing the corrosion, rinse the area thoroughly with clean water and apply a protective coating designed for aluminum.  For more severe corrosion, you might need to consult a professional window repair service.

Once you've washed and rinsed your aluminum storm windows, it's time to dry them thoroughly. Use clean, dry microfiber cloths to wipe down the frames and glass, preventing water spots and streaks. Pay attention to the corners and edges, where water tends to accumulate. 

After drying, take a final look at your windows. Check for any remaining dirt or streaks, and touch up as needed. Also, inspect the windows for any signs of damage, such as cracks or loose hardware. Addressing these issues promptly will help extend the life of your storm windows.  Remember to clean your windows regularly – [how often to clean windows](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-often-to-clean-windows) depends on your environment.

Trim any bushes or trees that are close to the windows, as these can contribute to dirt buildup. Consider applying a protective coating to the aluminum frames to help prevent corrosion.
