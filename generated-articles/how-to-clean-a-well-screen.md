## Keeping Your Water Flowing: How To Clean A Well Screen

Is your water pressure dropping? Are you noticing sediment in your water? A clogged well screen could be the culprit. Cleaning your well screen is a vital part of maintaining a healthy and efficient water supply for your home. This article will walk you through everything you need to know about cleaning your well screen, from identifying when it needs cleaning to the best methods for getting it done. We’ll cover the tools you’ll need, step-by-step instructions, and preventative measures to keep your well water flowing freely.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly inspect your well screen for buildup.
*   Backflushing is often the first step in cleaning.
*   Physical cleaning may be necessary for stubborn blockages.
*   Preventative measures can extend the time between cleanings.

**What Does a Well Screen Do, and Why Clean It?**

A well screen prevents sand, gravel, and other debris from entering your well and potentially damaging your pump. Over time, these particles accumulate on the screen, restricting water flow and reducing your well’s yield. A clean well screen ensures optimal water pressure and maintains the quality of your water supply. Ignoring this maintenance can lead to costly repairs or even the need for well rehabilitation.

## Identifying When Your Well Screen Needs Cleaning

Before you start, it’s important to confirm that a clogged well screen is actually the problem. Several signs indicate it’s time for a cleaning. Reduced water pressure is a common indicator, as is sediment in your water. You might also notice your well pump cycling on and off more frequently than usual. A professional well inspection can definitively diagnose the issue, but these signs are a good starting point.

## Backflushing Your Well Screen: A First Step

Backflushing is often the easiest and most effective first step in cleaning a well screen. This process reverses the flow of water through the screen, dislodging loose sediment and debris. To backflush, you’ll typically need to contact a well service professional who has the equipment to do this safely and effectively. They will use a specialized pump to force water upwards through the well, flushing out the screen.

## Physically Cleaning Your Well Screen: A Step-by-Step Guide

If backflushing doesn’t fully resolve the issue, you may need to physically clean the well screen. This is a more involved process and often requires professional assistance. Here’s a general overview of the steps involved:

1.  **Shut off the power to the well pump.** Safety first!
2.  **Remove the well cap.** This provides access to the well casing and the screen.
3.  **Carefully lower a well screen brush or high-pressure water jet into the well.** Avoid damaging the pump or other components.
4.  **Scrub the screen thoroughly.** Focus on areas with visible buildup.
5.  **Flush the well with clean water.** This removes any dislodged debris.
6.  **Reinstall the well cap and restore power to the pump.**
7.  **Monitor your water pressure and quality.**

It’s crucial to note that working inside a well can be dangerous. Always prioritize safety and consider hiring a professional if you’re uncomfortable with any part of this process.

## Tools You’ll Need for Well Screen Cleaning

Having the right tools makes the job much easier and safer. Here’s a list of essential items:

*   **Well screen brush:** Specifically designed for cleaning well screens.
*   **High-pressure water jet:** Can be used to dislodge stubborn debris.
*   **Well cap wrench:** For safely removing the well cap.
*   **Safety glasses and gloves:** To protect your eyes and hands.
*   **Flashlight:** For visibility inside the well.
*   **Well inspection camera (optional):** Helps visualize the screen's condition.
*   **A professional well service company:** For backflushing or complex cleaning.

## Preventing Well Screen Clogging: Proactive Measures

Preventing a clogged well screen is always better than dealing with the consequences. Here are some proactive measures you can take:

*   **Install a sediment filter.** This removes particles before they reach the well screen.
*   **Regularly inspect your well.** Look for signs of sediment buildup or damage.
*   **Schedule periodic well maintenance.** A professional can assess the screen’s condition and recommend cleaning or repairs.
*   **Avoid over-pumping your well.** This can stir up sediment and accelerate clogging.
*   **Consider a well screen guard.** This adds an extra layer of protection against debris. [Keeping your windows clean can also improve water quality](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-often-to-clean-windows).

## Understanding Different Types of Well Screens

Different well screen designs require slightly different cleaning approaches. Common types include:

*   **Johnson screens:** These have a V-shaped wire profile that provides a large open area for water flow. They are relatively easy to clean.
*   **Continuous slot screens:** These feature a single, continuous slot that prevents debris from entering the well. They may require more aggressive cleaning methods.
*   **Bridge slot screens:** These have a bridge across the slot to provide additional strength. They are often used in sandy wells.

Knowing your well screen type can help you choose the most effective cleaning method.
