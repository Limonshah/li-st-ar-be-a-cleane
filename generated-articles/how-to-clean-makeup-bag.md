## Refresh Your Beauty Arsenal: How to Clean Makeup Bag Effectively

Do you ever wonder what is lurking inside your makeup bag? It holds all your beauty essentials, but it also collects spilled powder, leaky foundations, and stray glitter. Over time, your makeup bag can become a breeding ground for bacteria, dust, and general grime. This can transfer to your makeup products and even your skin.

Learning how to clean makeup bag properly is a simple step to maintain hygiene. It also helps preserve your favorite cosmetics. A clean makeup bag looks better and keeps your products safe. This guide provides a detailed walkthrough for cleaning different types of makeup bags. You will learn the best methods for various materials and tackle stubborn stains. We will help you keep your beauty essentials fresh and organized.

### Takeaway:

*   Regularly clean your makeup bag to prevent bacterial growth and extend product life.
*   Always empty your bag and remove debris before deep cleaning.
*   Choose cleaning methods based on the bag's material (fabric, leather, plastic).
*   Spot treat stubborn stains with appropriate cleaners before a full wash.
*   Ensure the bag is completely dry before storing makeup to prevent mold.

Keeping your makeup bag clean ensures a healthier beauty routine. It also makes your beauty tools last longer.

To clean a makeup bag, first empty all contents and shake out loose debris. For fabric bags, machine wash or hand wash with mild soap and warm water, then air dry completely. For non-washable materials like leather or plastic, wipe surfaces with a damp cloth and a gentle cleaner. Always spot treat stains before a full clean.

## The Importance of a Spotless Makeup Bag

Keeping your makeup bag clean is more than just about aesthetics. It is a critical part of maintaining good hygiene in your beauty routine. Many people overlook cleaning their makeup bags, but this space collects a lot of dirt. Your makeup bag comes into contact with many things throughout the day. It touches different surfaces and holds various products.

Over time, cosmetics can spill, powders can scatter, and brushes can transfer dirt. This creates a hidden environment where bacteria and germs can thrive. These microbes can then transfer to your makeup products. They can also transfer directly to your skin, leading to breakouts or even infections. Regular cleaning helps to prevent this build-up. It protects your skin and prolongs the life of your expensive makeup.

### Why Your Makeup Bag Needs Regular Cleaning

A dirty makeup bag is a hidden health hazard. I always think about what is touching my face. My makeup tools and products are often in contact with my skin. If my makeup bag is dirty, it can re-contaminate my clean brushes and sponges. This makes cleaning them pointless.

Studies show that makeup bags can harbor significant amounts of bacteria. This includes common strains like Staphylococcus. These can cause skin irritations, infections, or even eye problems. By cleaning your makeup bag, you remove these harmful agents. You create a healthier environment for your beauty routine. It is a simple step that has big benefits for your skin's health.

### Extending the Life of Your Beauty Products

Beyond hygiene, a clean makeup bag also helps protect your cosmetics. Spills and residues can degrade makeup products over time. Powders can clump and liquids can get sticky. This can damage the packaging or alter the product's texture. A clean bag prevents these issues.

It also keeps your makeup tools in better condition. Dirt and grime from the bag can stick to your brushes and sponges. This makes them less effective for makeup application. It can also cause them to wear out faster. I find that my makeup lasts longer and performs better when stored in a clean space. Cleaning your makeup bag is an investment in your beauty collection.

## Gathering Your Makeup Bag Cleaning Essentials

Before you dive into cleaning your makeup bag, it helps to have all your supplies ready. Think of it like preparing for a cooking project. Having everything at hand makes the process smoother and more efficient. The specific tools and cleaning solutions you need will depend on your bag's material. However, some basic items are good to have for any cleaning task.

I always start by laying out a towel or old newspaper. This protects my work surface from spills and dirt. Then, I gather a few gentle cleaning agents. Harsh chemicals can damage certain bag materials. I prefer using natural or mild solutions first. This approach is safer for my bag and my skin.

### Basic Tools and Supplies

You do not need a lot of fancy equipment to clean a makeup bag. Most of the items you need are probably already in your home. These simple tools will help you tackle common dirt and stains. I keep a dedicated set of cleaning cloths for these tasks. This ensures I am not cross-contaminating with kitchen rags.

Here are some essentials I recommend:

*   **Small trash can or bin:** For emptying contents and discarding debris.
*   **Microfiber cloths or soft sponges:** For wiping down surfaces without scratching them.
*   **Old toothbrush or small brush:** Great for scrubbing stubborn spots and tight corners.
*   **Paper towels:** Useful for absorbing excess moisture or quick clean-ups.
*   **Cotton swabs or Q-tips:** Perfect for getting into tiny crevices or zippers.

Having these items ready saves time. It ensures you can complete the cleaning task without interruption. It is all about being prepared.

### Choosing the Right Cleaning Solutions

The type of cleaning solution you use is crucial. It depends heavily on what your makeup bag is made of. What works for a fabric bag might harm a leather one. Always check the care label on your bag if it has one. When in doubt, it is always best to test a small, inconspicuous area first.

Here are common cleaning agents and their uses:

*   **Mild dish soap:** Excellent for most fabric, nylon, and plastic bags. Mix a few drops with warm water.
*   **Gentle laundry detergent:** For machine-washable fabric bags. Choose one without harsh bleaches.
*   **Rubbing alcohol or isopropyl alcohol:** Good for disinfecting surfaces. It can also help break down oil-based stains. Be careful with colored fabrics, as it might cause fading. You can learn more about how to clean makeup brushes with alcohol [here](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-makeup-brushes-with-alcohol).
*   **White vinegar:** A natural disinfectant and deodorizer. It is great for cutting through grime. You can find more tips on cleaning with vinegar, such as how to clean makeup brushes with vinegar [here](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-makeup-brushes-with-vinegar).
*   **Leather cleaner/conditioner:** Specifically formulated for leather and some faux leather bags. These keep the material soft and prevent cracking.
*   **Makeup remover:** Can be surprisingly effective for spot-cleaning makeup stains on many surfaces.
*   **Stain remover (pre-treater):** For tough, set-in stains on fabric bags.
*   **Baking soda:** Absorbs odors and can be used as a gentle abrasive paste for some stains.

Avoid using harsh bleaches, abrasive scrubbers, or strong chemical solvents. These can discolor, weaken, or ruin your makeup bag's material. Always prioritize gentle methods first.

## General Steps for Cleaning Any Makeup Bag

No matter the material, every makeup bag cleaning process starts with a few universal steps. These initial actions help prepare the bag for a deeper clean. They also ensure you do not miss any hidden dirt or debris. I follow these steps religiously every time I clean my bags. It makes the entire process more effective and less messy.

Starting with these foundational steps helps you tackle the most visible dirt first. This makes the specialized cleaning for different materials much easier. It is like sweeping before mopping. You get rid of the big stuff first.

### Emptying and Initial Debris Removal

This is the very first and most important step. I start by completely emptying everything out of my makeup bag. I mean everything. Even tiny samples or forgotten hairpins need to come out. This gives me a clear view of the bag's interior.

Once emptied, I turn the bag inside out, if possible. Then, I give it a good shake over a trash can. You will be surprised by how much loose powder, glitter, and tiny bits of debris fall out. For bags with many pockets or dividers, I use a small brush or a vacuum cleaner attachment to get into every corner. A lint roller can also be great for picking up stray glitter or lint from fabric linings.

### Spot Cleaning Minor Stains

After removing all loose debris, I move on to any visible spots or stains. Addressing these individually before a full wash is very effective. It prevents the stain from spreading or setting deeper during the main cleaning process. Think of it as pre-treating specific problem areas.

For small, fresh makeup smudges, I often use a damp cloth with a tiny bit of mild soap. For oil-based stains like foundation or concealer, a drop of dish soap directly on the stain can work wonders. I gently blot the stain, rather than rub, to avoid pushing it deeper into the fabric. If it is a more stubborn mark, I might use a small amount of makeup remover or rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab. Always remember to test on an inconspicuous area first, especially with alcohol.

### Wiping Down Interior and Exterior Surfaces

Once any spot treatments are applied (and ideally, left to work for a few minutes), I proceed to a general wipe-down. This step varies slightly depending on the bag's material. However, the goal is to remove surface grime and spills. For most bags, a damp cloth is your best friend.

I dampen a clean microfiber cloth with warm water and a tiny amount of mild soap solution. Then, I gently wipe down all interior and exterior surfaces. For non-washable materials, this might be your main cleaning step. For washable bags, it prepares them for a deeper clean. I pay extra attention to zippers, seams, and corners where dirt tends to accumulate. Using a cotton swab helps reach tight spots. This general wipe-down brings a fresh look to the bag.

## How to Clean Fabric Makeup Bags

Fabric makeup bags are among the most common and, thankfully, often the easiest to clean. Their versatility in material, from cotton to canvas to nylon, usually means they can withstand a good wash. However, even with fabric bags, it is important to know the right approach. Some fabrics are more delicate than others.

I always check the care tag first if my bag has one. This tag provides specific washing instructions from the manufacturer. If there is no tag, I usually err on the side of caution. Hand washing is almost always a safe bet for fabric makeup bags. For sturdier materials, machine washing can save time and effort.

### Machine Washing Fabric Bags

If your fabric makeup bag is made of durable materials like canvas, nylon, or certain types of cotton, it might be machine washable. This is the easiest method for a thorough clean. I find it very convenient for my larger fabric organizers. Always remember to protect the bag during the wash cycle.

Here's my process for machine washing:

1.  **Prepare the bag:** Ensure it is completely empty. Turn it inside out if the lining is a different material or if there are internal pockets.
2.  **Pre-treat stains:** Apply a laundry pre-treater or a little liquid laundry detergent directly onto any stubborn stains. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes.
3.  **Use a mesh laundry bag:** Place your makeup bag inside a mesh laundry bag. This protects the bag from snagging or getting damaged by the washing machine's agitator. It also prevents small parts from getting lost.
4.  **Select wash settings:** Use cold or lukewarm water to prevent shrinking or color fading. Choose a gentle cycle.
5.  **Add detergent:** Use a mild laundry detergent. Avoid using excessive amounts, which can leave residue.
6.  **Wash:** Run the machine.
7.  **Air dry:** Once the cycle is complete, remove the bag immediately. Reshape it and allow it to air dry completely. Never put fabric makeup bags in the dryer unless the tag explicitly says it is safe. High heat can shrink them or damage zippers and embellishments.

For bags with plastic linings, ensure the plastic does not stick together during drying. You can turn them inside out or prop them open. This method works well for many casual makeup bags. You might find similar advice for how to wash a duffel bag [here](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-a-duffel-bag).

### Hand Washing Delicate or Lined Fabric Bags

Some fabric makeup bags, especially those with delicate embellishments, structured shapes, or non-removable plastic linings, are better off being hand washed. This method gives you more control and prevents damage. I prefer hand washing for my smaller, more intricate cosmetic pouches.

Here’s how I hand wash:

1.  **Prepare a basin:** Fill a clean basin or sink with lukewarm water. Add a few drops of mild dish soap or gentle laundry detergent.
2.  **Submerge the bag:** Gently submerge the empty makeup bag in the soapy water. Squeeze it gently to allow the water to penetrate the fabric.
3.  **Light scrub:** Use a soft cloth or a clean sponge to gently scrub the interior and exterior surfaces. For stubborn spots, use an old toothbrush.
4.  **Rinse thoroughly:** Drain the soapy water. Refill the basin with clean, cool water. Rinse the bag repeatedly until all soap suds are gone. You might need to press the bag against the side of the basin to squeeze out soapy water.
5.  **Remove excess water:** Gently press the bag between two clean towels to absorb as much water as possible. Do not wring it out forcefully, as this can distort its shape.
6.  **Air dry:** Reshape the bag and allow it to air dry completely. Prop it open to ensure air circulation, especially for lined bags. A small fan can help speed up drying. Ensure it is bone dry before putting any makeup back inside. This prevents mold and mildew.

Hand washing is a gentler approach that protects your bag's integrity. It ensures it remains in good shape for a longer time.

## Cleaning Leather and Faux Leather Makeup Bags

Leather and faux leather makeup bags require a much different approach than fabric ones. These materials are sensitive to water and harsh chemicals. Using the wrong products can cause cracking, discoloration, or irreversible damage. I always treat my leather bags with extra care. They are often more expensive and last longer with proper maintenance.

The key with leather and faux leather is gentle cleaning and conditioning. You want to remove dirt without stripping the material's natural oils or damaging its surface. Spot cleaning is often the preferred method, with full submersion being a definite no-go.

### Gentle Cleaning for Leather Bags

Real leather needs specific care to stay supple and prevent drying out. Water can leave marks on leather, so it is best to use a minimal amount. I always recommend testing any cleaning product on an hidden spot first. This ensures it does not cause discoloration or damage. You can get more tips on how to clean leather bag stains [here](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-leather-bag-stain).

Here’s how I clean my leather makeup bags:

1.  **Dust removal:** Start by wiping down the entire bag with a dry, soft microfiber cloth to remove dust and loose dirt.
2.  **Prepare cleaning solution:** Mix a few drops of mild, non-detergent soap (like saddle soap or a very mild castile soap) with distilled water. The solution should be very diluted.
3.  **Damp cloth application:** Dampen a clean, soft cloth with the soap solution. Wring it out extremely well so it is barely damp. You do not want to soak the leather.
4.  **Wipe gently:** Gently wipe down the exterior and interior surfaces of the bag. Use light, circular motions. Do not scrub harshly. Focus on areas with visible grime.
5.  **Rinse cloth:** Rinse your cloth with plain water and wring it out again. Wipe the bag a second time to remove any soap residue.
6.  **Pat dry:** Immediately pat the bag dry with a separate clean, dry towel. Do not let water sit on the leather.
7.  **Air dry:** Allow the bag to air dry completely in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight or heat.
8.  **Condition:** Once dry, apply a specialized leather conditioner. This step is vital to restore moisture and keep the leather soft and supple. Apply with a clean cloth, following the product's instructions.

This method helps keep leather looking good and prevents it from cracking over time.

### Caring for Faux Leather and Vegan Leather

Faux leather (also known as vegan leather or PU leather) is more forgiving than real leather but still requires careful handling. It is often a coated fabric, so harsh chemicals can break down the coating. While it can handle a bit more moisture than real leather, submersion is still not recommended.

Here’s my approach for cleaning faux leather bags:

1.  **Wipe down:** Use a dry cloth to remove loose dirt and dust.
2.  **Soap solution:** Create a solution of warm water and a very small amount of mild dish soap.
3.  **Damp cloth:** Dampen a microfiber cloth with the solution and wring it out well.
4.  **Wipe surfaces:** Wipe down the interior and exterior of the bag. Faux leather can usually handle a bit more wiping pressure than real leather.
5.  **Remove soap:** Use a second clean, damp cloth (with just water) to wipe away any soap residue.
6.  **Dry completely:** Pat dry with a clean towel and then air dry in a well-ventilated space. Faux leather generally dries faster than real leather.
7.  **Avoid conditioners:** Faux leather does not absorb conditioners like real leather. Using them can leave a sticky residue. Stick to wiping and drying.

For both leather types, consistent, gentle care is the best strategy. Avoiding direct contact with makeup spills in the first place also helps immensely.

## Tackling Stubborn Stains in Your Makeup Bag

Even with regular cleaning, makeup bags are bound to get stubborn stains. Foundation, lipstick, mascara, and eyeliner are common culprits. These can be particularly challenging to remove, especially if they have set in. But do not despair! With the right approach, many tough makeup stains can be effectively treated.

The key to successful stain removal is often knowing what kind of stain you are dealing with. Oil-based stains require different treatment than pigment-based ones. Always act quickly if you notice a fresh spill. The longer a stain sits, the harder it is to remove.

### Removing Oil-Based Stains (Foundation, Concealer, Lipstick)

Oil-based makeup stains like foundation and lipstick are notorious for leaving greasy marks. They can be tricky, but I have had good success with a few methods. The goal is to break down the oil so it can be lifted from the fabric or surface. You can find more tips on how to clean grease stains [here](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-grease-stains).

Here’s what I recommend:

*   **For fabric bags:**
    1.  **Blot excess:** Gently blot any excess makeup with a clean paper towel. Do not rub, as this pushes the stain deeper.
    2.  **Dish soap:** Apply a small amount of liquid dish soap directly to the stain. Dish soap is designed to cut through grease.
    3.  **Gentle scrub:** Use an old toothbrush or your finger to gently work the soap into the stain.
    4.  **Let it sit:** Allow it to sit for 10-15 minutes.
    5.  **Rinse/wash:** Rinse the area with warm water or, for washable bags, proceed with machine or hand washing.
    6.  **Repeat if needed:** If the stain persists, repeat the process.
    7.  **Rubbing alcohol (as a last resort):** For very stubborn foundation or lipstick on durable fabric, a small amount of rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball can help. Test first, as it may discolor some fabrics.
*   **For leather/faux leather bags:**
    1.  **Blot immediately:** Quickly blot fresh spills with a clean, dry cloth.
    2.  **Cornstarch/talcum powder:** For fresh oil stains, sprinkle cornstarch or talcum powder over the stain. Let it sit for several hours (or overnight) to absorb the oil.
    3.  **Brush away:** Gently brush off the powder.
    4.  **Gentle wipe:** Follow with a gentle wipe using a damp cloth and mild soap solution (as described in the leather cleaning section). Avoid rubbing.

### Eradicating Pigment Stains (Eyeshadow, Mascara, Eyeliner)

Pigment-based stains can leave vibrant marks that seem impossible to get out. These include eyeshadow, mascara, and liquid eyeliner. The key here is to lift the pigment without smearing it.

*   **For fabric bags:**
    1.  **Scrape/shake off dry powder:** For eyeshadow, try to gently shake or brush off as much loose powder as possible before wetting.
    2.  **Makeup remover:** Apply a tiny amount of oil-free makeup remover (the kind you use for your eyes) onto a cotton swab.
    3.  **Dab, don't rub:** Gently dab the stain from the outside in. This prevents the stain from spreading.
    4.  **Rinse and wash:** Rinse the area with water and then wash the bag as per its material guidelines.
    5.  **Laundry detergent paste:** For mascara or eyeliner, a paste made from laundry detergent and a tiny bit of water can be applied directly to the stain. Let it sit, then rinse and wash.
*   **For leather/faux leather bags:**
    1.  **Gentle wipe:** For fresh mascara or eyeliner, immediately wipe gently with a very slightly damp cloth.
    2.  **Mild soap:** If a mark remains, use a tiny amount of mild soap solution on a cotton swab. Dab very gently.
    3.  **Professional help:** For stubborn, dried pigment stains on real leather, it might be best to consult a leather cleaning professional. Trying to scrub too hard can damage the leather finish.

### Dealing with General Grime and Odor

Sometimes, your makeup bag just feels generally grimy or has a stale odor, even without obvious stains. This is usually due to accumulated dust, oils, and product residues.

*   **For all bags (odor control):**
    1.  **Baking soda:** After cleaning and drying, sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda inside the bag. Close it and let it sit overnight or for a few days.
    2.  **Shake out:** Shake out the baking soda completely. It absorbs odors very well.
    3.  **Sunlight:** For a natural deodorizer and disinfectant, place your empty, clean bag in direct sunlight for a few hours. This helps kill bacteria and dissipate odors.
*   **For general grimy feel (fabric):** A good machine wash or thorough hand wash (as described above) is usually sufficient to refresh the fabric.
*   **For general grimy feel (leather/faux leather):** Regular gentle wiping with a slightly damp cloth and mild soap solution will prevent grime buildup. For tougher situations, ensure you are using appropriate leather cleaners that also condition.

Patience is key when removing stubborn stains. Sometimes, a stain needs more than one treatment.

## Drying and Maintaining Your Clean Makeup Bag

Cleaning your makeup bag is only half the battle. Proper drying is just as important, if not more so. A damp makeup bag is an open invitation for mold, mildew, and unpleasant odors. This can ruin your bag and contaminate your clean makeup. Maintenance helps keep it clean between deep washes.

I never rush the drying process. I make sure my bag is completely dry before putting anything back inside. This prevents any musty smells and protects my makeup. Good maintenance habits also mean I do not have to clean it as often.

### Essential Drying Techniques

Air drying is almost always the best method for makeup bags. High heat from a dryer can warp plastic liners, melt adhesives, or shrink certain fabrics and damage zippers. Patience is truly a virtue here.

Here are my drying techniques:

*   **Air dry completely:** After washing, gently reshape your bag. Hang it upside down or prop it open in a well-ventilated area. A clothesline, a drying rack, or even a hanger in an open doorway works well.
*   **Promote airflow:** For bags with internal compartments or linings, ensure air can circulate throughout. You can use a small fan to speed up the process. Open all zippers and pockets.
*   **Avoid direct heat:** Keep the bag away from direct sunlight (which can fade colors) or direct heat sources like radiators or hair dryers. This prevents damage and ensures even drying.
*   **The paper towel trick:** For bags with absorbent linings, stuff clean paper towels inside. They will help wick away moisture. Replace them periodically until the bag is dry.
*   **Check for dampness:** Before you consider the bag dry, feel every part of it. Pay special attention to seams, corners, and linings. If it feels even slightly damp, let it dry longer. This step is crucial to prevent mold growth.

Depending on the bag's material and thickness, drying can take anywhere from a few hours to a full day or two. Be patient.

### Tips for Regular Maintenance

Between deep cleaning sessions, you can do a few simple things to keep your makeup bag in good shape. These small steps reduce the frequency of thorough washes. They also help prevent excessive build-up of dirt and bacteria.

Here are my tips for maintaining a clean makeup bag:

*   **Empty and shake out regularly:** Once a week, or whenever you notice loose debris, empty your bag and give it a good shake. This gets rid of crumbs, stray powders, and glitter.
*   **Wipe down inner lining:** Use a damp cloth to quickly wipe the interior lining every couple of weeks. This catches small spills before they become set-in stains.
*   **Clean your makeup tools:** The cleaner your makeup brushes and sponges are, the cleaner your makeup bag will stay. Make sure brushes are completely dry before putting them back. Learn how to clean makeup sponges and brushes [here](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-makeup-sponges-and-brushes).
*   **Store products properly:** Ensure all your makeup products are closed tightly. Use travel containers for liquids or creams that might leak.
*   **Use smaller pouches:** Consider using smaller, clear pouches inside your main makeup bag to compartmentalize products. If one product leaks, it only affects a small, easily cleanable pouch.
*   **Air out your bag:** Every now and then, leave your empty makeup bag open to air out. This helps dissipate any lingering odors.
*   **Address spills immediately:** If something spills, clean it up right away. Fresh spills are always easier to clean than dried ones.

By following these maintenance tips, your makeup bag will stay cleaner for longer. This reduces the work needed for deep cleaning. It also creates a more hygienic environment for your beauty routine.

## Special Considerations for Different Makeup Bag Types

While the general cleaning methods cover most makeup bags, some specific types have unique requirements. Understanding these nuances helps you provide the best care for your specific bag. For instance, a clear plastic bag will not be cleaned like a structured designer bag.

I have found that paying attention to these details prevents accidental damage. It ensures my different bags last longer and stay looking their best. It is about tailoring the cleaning method to the bag's unique construction.

### Clear Plastic and Vinyl Makeup Bags

Clear plastic or vinyl makeup bags are popular because you can easily see what is inside. They are also usually water-resistant and relatively easy to clean. However, they can scratch easily and are sensitive to harsh chemicals. Also, clear materials show dirt and smudges more readily.

Here’s how I clean them:

1.  **Empty and shake:** As always, remove everything and shake out loose debris.
2.  **Mild soap solution:** Mix a few drops of mild dish soap with warm water.
3.  **Soft cloth wipe:** Dampen a soft microfiber cloth with the solution. Wring it out well.
4.  **Wipe thoroughly:** Wipe down all interior and exterior surfaces. For stubborn spots or sticky residues, you can gently rub. For more tips on how to clean stains on plastic, click [here](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-stains-on-plastic).
5.  **Rinse cloth:** Rinse your cloth with plain water and wipe again to remove soap residue.
6.  **Dry completely:** Use a separate clean, dry cloth to wipe the bag dry immediately. Do not let water spots air dry, as they can leave streaks. Clear plastic dries quickly.
7.  **Avoid abrasives:** Never use abrasive scrubbers or harsh cleaning agents like ammonia-based cleaners. These can scratch or cloud the plastic.
8.  **Disinfect:** For disinfection, a very diluted solution of rubbing alcohol (1:1 with water) on a cotton pad can be used sparingly, then wiped off quickly. Test in a hidden area first.

### Structured and Designer Makeup Bags
