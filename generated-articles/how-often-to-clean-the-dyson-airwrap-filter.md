## Keeping Your Style Flowing: How Often To Clean Your Dyson Airwrap Filter

Have you noticed your Dyson Airwrap isn’t performing quite like it used to? Reduced airflow and overheating can often be traced back to a clogged filter. Cleaning your Dyson Airwrap filter is a simple task that can significantly improve its performance and extend its lifespan. This article will guide you through everything you need to know about maintaining your Airwrap’s filter, ensuring you get the most out of this popular styling tool. We’ll cover how often to clean it, the cleaning process, and what happens if you neglect this important maintenance step.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly cleaning your Dyson Airwrap filter (every 2-3 weeks with regular use) maintains optimal airflow.
*   A clogged filter can lead to overheating and reduced performance.
*   Cleaning is a simple process that extends the life of your Airwrap.

**How often should you clean the Dyson Airwrap filter?**

With regular use, aim to clean your Dyson Airwrap filter every 2-3 weeks. If you use hair products frequently, or style your hair less often, you may need to adjust this schedule. 

### Why Cleaning Your Dyson Airwrap Filter Matters

The Dyson Airwrap is a powerful styling tool, but its effectiveness relies on consistent airflow. The filter’s job is to prevent dust, hair, and product buildup from entering the motor. Over time, this filter becomes clogged, restricting airflow and forcing the motor to work harder. This can lead to several issues, including reduced suction, overheating, and even potential damage to the machine. Maintaining a clean filter ensures your Airwrap continues to deliver salon-quality results.  Think of it like breathing – a clear airway is essential for optimal function!

### Identifying a Clogged Dyson Airwrap Filter

Knowing when to clean your filter is crucial. Several signs indicate it’s time for a refresh.  First, you might notice reduced airflow when using the attachments.  Second, the Airwrap may feel hotter than usual during use.  Finally, a visible buildup of dust and hair around the filter intake is a clear indicator it needs cleaning. Don’t ignore these signs; addressing them promptly will prevent more serious problems.

### The Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Your Airwrap Filter

Cleaning the Dyson Airwrap filter is surprisingly easy and requires minimal effort. Here’s a breakdown of the process:

1.  **Locate the Filter:** The filter is typically found on the handle of the Airwrap, often covered by a removable grille.
2.  **Remove the Filter:** Gently twist or slide the grille to remove it, then carefully pull out the filter.
3.  **Clean the Filter:** Use a soft brush (like a toothbrush) or the dusting attachment of your vacuum to remove loose dust and hair. For a deeper clean, you can gently wash the filter with lukewarm water. *Do not use soap or detergents.*
4.  **Dry Thoroughly:** Allow the filter to air dry completely – this is *essential* before reassembling.  Never reinsert a damp filter.
5.  **Reassemble:** Once dry, reinsert the filter and secure the grille.

### Deep Cleaning vs. Regular Maintenance

While the above steps cover regular maintenance, a deeper clean might be necessary occasionally. If you notice stubborn buildup, consider using a small amount of isopropyl alcohol on a cotton swab to gently clean the filter mesh. Again, ensure the filter is completely dry before reassembling.

Remember, preventative maintenance is always easier than dealing with a malfunctioning device.

### What Happens If You Don’t Clean the Filter?

Neglecting to clean your Dyson Airwrap filter can have several negative consequences. The most immediate is reduced performance – your Airwrap simply won’t style as effectively.  More seriously, a clogged filter can cause the motor to overheat, potentially leading to damage and shortening the lifespan of your device. In extreme cases, overheating can even pose a safety hazard.  Investing a few minutes every few weeks to clean the filter is a small price to pay to protect your investment and ensure safe operation.

Cleaning the filter is just one part of maintaining your Dyson Airwrap. Here are a few additional tips to help extend its lifespan:

*   **Store Properly:** Store your Airwrap in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.
*   **Clean Attachments:** Regularly clean the attachments to remove hair and product buildup.
*   **Avoid Dropping:** Handle your Airwrap with care to prevent damage from drops.
*   **Use Genuine Accessories:** Using non-genuine accessories can potentially damage the device.
*   **Regularly check the cord:** Inspect the power cord for any signs of damage.



### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can I use compressed air to clean the Dyson Airwrap filter?**

A: While compressed air can remove some loose debris, it’s not a substitute for a thorough cleaning with a brush or gentle washing. It may also push debris further into the filter.

A: If the filter is damaged, torn, or cannot be adequately cleaned, it’s time to replace it. Dyson recommends replacing the filter annually, depending on usage.

A: No, avoid using soap or detergents as they can leave residue that affects performance. Lukewarm water is sufficient for cleaning.

**Q: What if my Dyson Airwrap still overheats after cleaning the filter?**

A: If overheating persists, there may be another issue, such as a problem with the motor or internal components. Contact Dyson customer support for assistance.

**Q: Is it okay to use the Dyson Airwrap while the filter is drying?**

A: Absolutely not. Using the Airwrap with a damp filter can cause serious damage to the motor. Ensure the filter is completely dry before reassembling and using the device.
