This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get the most out of your machine, from setup to cleaning and maintenance. We’ll cover how to use the Bissell Clean & Refresh effectively, ensuring a cleaner, fresher home. Let's dive in and learn how to breathe new life into your living spaces!

**Takeaway:**

*   Prepare your Bissell Clean & Refresh by filling the tanks with the correct solutions.
*   Test the machine on an inconspicuous area before full cleaning.
*   Use slow, overlapping passes for optimal cleaning results.
*   Regularly clean and maintain your machine to prolong its lifespan.

**Quick Answer:** To use the Bissell Clean & Refresh, fill the clean tank with warm water and Bissell cleaning solution, insert the cartridge, and plug in the machine. Test on a hidden area, then slowly glide the machine over your carpet or upholstery, using overlapping passes.



## 1. Getting Started: Setting Up Your Bissell Clean & Refresh

Before you begin, it’s important to properly set up your Bissell Clean & Refresh. This ensures the machine operates safely and effectively. First, locate the clean and dirty water tanks.  The clean water tank is where you’ll add your cleaning solution, while the dirty water tank collects the extracted grime.  Fill the clean water tank with warm tap water and the recommended amount of Bissell cleaning formula – always check the formula’s instructions for the correct ratio.  

Next, insert a Bissell cleaning cartridge into the designated slot. These cartridges help to release the cleaning solution evenly. Finally, ensure the machine is plugged into a grounded outlet.

## 2. Pre-Cleaning Preparation: Protecting Your Surfaces

Protecting your surfaces is crucial before using any cleaning machine. Always test the Bissell Clean & Refresh on an inconspicuous area of your carpet or upholstery. This helps to ensure the cleaning solution doesn’t cause any discoloration or damage. Vacuum the area thoroughly to remove loose dirt and debris. This prevents the machine from simply pushing dirt around and allows it to focus on deeper cleaning. 

Consider moving furniture to create more space and allow for easier maneuverability.  If you're cleaning upholstery, check the manufacturer’s cleaning code (usually found on a tag) to ensure it’s suitable for wet cleaning.  If you're dealing with stubborn stains, pre-treating them with a Bissell stain remover can significantly improve results.



## 3. The Cleaning Process: Mastering the Technique

Now for the main event: cleaning!  Turn on the Bissell Clean & Refresh and begin with slow, overlapping passes.  Avoid rushing, as this prevents the machine from effectively lifting dirt and grime.  Focus on areas with high traffic or visible stains.  

Maintain consistent pressure while gliding the machine across the surface.  For upholstery, use the appropriate attachment and gently work the nozzle into the fabric.  Remember to empty the dirty water tank frequently, especially if you’re cleaning a heavily soiled area.  If you're looking for a deeper clean, consider using a Bissell CrossWave, and learn [how to clean a Bissell Crosswave](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bissell-crosswave) for optimal performance.



## 4. Tackling Different Surfaces: Carpets, Rugs, and Upholstery

The Bissell Clean & Refresh is versatile and can be used on various surfaces. For carpets, use the standard cleaning head and follow the slow, overlapping pass technique. For area rugs, be mindful of the rug’s material and adjust the cleaning solution accordingly. Delicate rugs may require a gentler formula. 

When cleaning upholstery, use the appropriate attachment – typically a smaller nozzle designed for fabrics.  Avoid over-saturating the fabric, as this can lead to mildew growth.  For pet owners, the Bissell Pet Pro is a great option, and you can learn [how to clean a Bissell Pet Pro](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bissell-pet-pro) for tackling pet messes effectively.



## 5. Post-Cleaning Care: Drying and Ventilation

After cleaning, proper drying is essential to prevent mold and mildew.  Ensure the room is well-ventilated by opening windows or using fans.  Avoid walking on the cleaned area until it’s completely dry.  This typically takes several hours, depending on humidity and airflow. 

You can speed up the drying process by using a dehumidifier.  For upholstery, fluff the cushions and allow them to air dry completely.  Regularly cleaning your Bissell machine is also important.

## 6. Maintaining Your Bissell Clean & Refresh: Ensuring Longevity

Regular maintenance will extend the life of your Bissell Clean & Refresh. After each use, empty and rinse both the clean and dirty water tanks thoroughly.  Allow the tanks to air dry completely before storing the machine.  

Periodically clean the spray nozzle and hose to prevent clogs.  You can use a mild detergent and warm water for this purpose.  Replace the cleaning cartridge as recommended by the manufacturer.  If you notice a decrease in suction power, check the filters and clean or replace them as needed.  



## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues: Quick Fixes

Sometimes, you might encounter issues while using your Bissell Clean & Refresh. If the machine isn’t picking up water, check the dirty water tank to ensure it’s not full. Also, inspect the hose and nozzle for any blockages. If the machine is leaking, ensure the tanks are properly sealed and the hoses are securely connected. 

If you’re still experiencing problems, consult the user manual or visit the Bissell website for troubleshooting tips.
