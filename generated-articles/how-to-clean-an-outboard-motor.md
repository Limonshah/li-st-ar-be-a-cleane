## Keeping Your Engine Running: How To Clean An Outboard Motor

Is your outboard motor looking a little worse for wear? A clean outboard motor isn’t just about appearances; it’s crucial for performance and longevity. Saltwater, grime, and fuel residue can build up, causing corrosion and reducing efficiency. This guide will walk you through a comprehensive cleaning process, ensuring your engine stays in top shape for years to come. We’ll cover everything from flushing the engine to detailing the exterior, helping you maintain a reliable and powerful boating experience.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly flush your outboard motor with freshwater.
*   Use a specialized marine engine degreaser to remove stubborn grime.
*   Protect metal surfaces with a corrosion inhibitor.
*   Inspect and lubricate moving parts during cleaning.

**Quick Answer:** Cleaning an outboard motor involves flushing it with freshwater after each use, applying a marine degreaser to remove salt and grime, inspecting for corrosion, lubricating key components, and protecting it with a corrosion inhibitor. Regular cleaning prevents damage and ensures optimal performance.

## 1. Why Cleaning Your Outboard Motor Matters

Regularly cleaning your outboard motor is a vital part of boat ownership. Saltwater is incredibly corrosive, and if left unchecked, it can cause significant damage to the engine's internal and external components. This damage can lead to costly repairs or even premature engine failure. Beyond corrosion, accumulated grime and debris can also impede cooling, reducing performance and potentially causing overheating.  Taking the time to clean your engine will save you money and headaches in the long run.

## 2. Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Before you begin, having the right tools and supplies is essential. You’ll need a few key items to effectively clean your outboard motor. First, gather a supply of fresh water and a garden hose with a spray nozzle. A marine-specific engine degreaser is crucial for breaking down salt, oil, and grime.  You’ll also want a soft-bristled brush, various rags, and a corrosion inhibitor spray.  Finally, consider having some lubricating grease on hand for moving parts.  For tougher stains, you might also want to consider a plastic scraper.

## 3. Flushing Your Outboard Motor: The First Step

Flushing your outboard motor with freshwater after *every* use is the single most important thing you can do to prevent corrosion. This removes the majority of the saltwater and harmful minerals. Most outboards have a flushing port, often located near the water intake. Attach a garden hose to the port and run fresh water through the engine for 10-15 minutes.  If your engine doesn’t have a flushing port, you can run it in a large tub of water, ensuring the water intake is submerged.  This process removes salt and debris before they have a chance to cause damage.

## 4. Deep Cleaning: Degreasing and Scrubbing

After flushing, it’s time for a more thorough cleaning. Apply a marine engine degreaser to the entire engine surface, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Let the degreaser sit for the recommended time, allowing it to break down the grime. Then, use a soft-bristled brush to scrub away the loosened dirt and residue. Pay close attention to areas where salt and grime tend to accumulate, such as around the propeller, lower unit, and cooling fins. Rinse thoroughly with freshwater, ensuring all traces of the degreaser are removed.

### Dealing with Stubborn Stains

Sometimes, degreasing and scrubbing aren’t enough to remove stubborn stains. For these cases, a plastic scraper can be helpful, but use it gently to avoid scratching the engine’s finish. You can also try a specialized marine stain remover, but always test it in an inconspicuous area first. Remember to rinse thoroughly after using any cleaning product.

## 5. Inspecting for Corrosion and Lubricating Parts

While the engine is clean, take the opportunity to inspect it for signs of corrosion. Look for rust, pitting, or discoloration on metal surfaces. Address any corrosion immediately with a corrosion inhibitor.  Also, inspect all moving parts, such as the steering arm and throttle linkage. Apply a marine-grade lubricant to these parts to ensure smooth operation and prevent corrosion.  Proper lubrication is key to preventing wear and tear.  Understanding how to maintain these parts is similar to the care needed for a [brushless motor](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-brushless-motor), where smooth operation relies on clean and lubricated components.

## 6. Protecting Your Investment: Corrosion Inhibition

Once the engine is clean and lubricated, apply a corrosion inhibitor spray to all exposed metal surfaces. This creates a protective barrier against saltwater and other corrosive elements. Pay particular attention to areas prone to corrosion, such as the lower unit and electrical connections.  Reapply the corrosion inhibitor periodically, especially after extended use in saltwater. This simple step can significantly extend the life of your outboard motor.

## 7. Final Touches and Storage

After applying the corrosion inhibitor, give the engine a final wipe-down with a clean rag. Ensure all surfaces are dry before storing or covering the engine. If you’re storing your boat for the winter, consider applying a more robust protective coating.  Proper storage is just as important as regular cleaning.  Keeping your boat clean inside and out, including the [carpet in a boat](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-carpet-in-a-boat), will help preserve its value and ensure it’s ready for your next adventure.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How often should I clean my outboard motor?**
A: Ideally, you should flush your outboard motor with freshwater after *every* use. A more thorough cleaning with degreaser should be done at least once a month, or more frequently if you use your boat in saltwater often.

**Q: What type of degreaser should I use?**
A: Always use a marine-specific engine degreaser. These are formulated to safely and effectively remove salt, oil, and grime without damaging the engine’s components.

**Q: Can I use a pressure washer to clean my outboard motor?**
A: While a pressure washer *can* be used, it’s generally not recommended. The high pressure can damage sensitive components and force water into areas where it shouldn’t be.

**Q: How do I prevent corrosion on my outboard motor?**
A: Regular flushing, degreasing, and applying a corrosion inhibitor are the best ways to prevent corrosion. Also, ensure all electrical connections are clean and protected.

**Q: What should I do if I notice rust on my outboard motor?**
A: Remove the rust with a wire brush or sandpaper, then apply a corrosion inhibitor to prevent it from returning. If the rust is severe, consult a marine mechanic.



## Conclusion

Cleaning your outboard motor is a straightforward process that can significantly extend its life and maintain its performance. By following these steps – flushing, degreasing, inspecting, lubricating, and protecting – you can ensure your engine remains reliable and powerful for years to come. Remember, a little preventative maintenance goes a long way.
