## Toro Lawn Mower Won't Stay Running: Troubleshooting Guide

Is your weekend mowing session cut short because your Toro lawn mower keeps dying? It’s incredibly frustrating when your mower starts, but then shuts off after only a few minutes of use. This is a common problem with Toro mowers, and thankfully, many of the causes are easily fixable. This article will walk you through the most likely reasons why your Toro lawn mower won’t stay running and provide step-by-step solutions to get you back to a beautifully manicured lawn. We’ll cover everything from fuel issues to carburetor problems and spark plug concerns.

**Takeaway:**

*   Check the fuel line for blockages.
*   Clean or replace the air filter.
*   Inspect and clean the carburetor.
*   Ensure the spark plug is clean and functioning.
*   Verify proper engine cooling.

**Quick Answer:** A Toro lawn mower that won’t stay running usually indicates a fuel delivery problem, a dirty carburetor, or an issue with the spark plug. Addressing these common culprits will often resolve the issue and get your mower running consistently.

## 1. Fuel System Issues: The Most Common Culprit

Often, a Toro lawn mower that dies quickly has a problem with its fuel system. The engine needs a consistent supply of fuel to keep running, and any interruption will cause it to stall. Let's look at the common fuel-related issues.

First, check your fuel. Old or stale gasoline can cause significant problems. Gasoline degrades over time, especially when left sitting in the tank over the winter. Drain the old fuel and replace it with fresh gasoline.  Next, inspect the fuel line for kinks or blockages. A blocked fuel line restricts fuel flow to the carburetor.  You can disconnect the fuel line at both ends and blow it out with compressed air. If the fuel line is cracked or damaged, replace it.  Finally, ensure the fuel cap vent is clear. A clogged vent creates a vacuum in the fuel tank, preventing fuel from flowing properly.

## 2. Dirty Air Filter: Restricting Airflow

A dirty air filter restricts airflow to the engine, leading to an improper air-fuel mixture. This can cause the engine to run poorly and eventually stall.  Think of it like trying to breathe through a clogged nose – it’s difficult and inefficient. 

To check the air filter, locate the air filter housing (usually a plastic cover on the engine). Remove the cover and inspect the air filter. If it’s dirty, you have a couple of options. You can try cleaning a foam air filter with soap and water, allowing it to dry completely before reinstalling. Paper air filters should be replaced.  Regularly cleaning or replacing your air filter is a simple maintenance task that can significantly improve your mower’s performance.

## 3. Carburetor Problems: A Frequent Cause of Stalling

The carburetor mixes air and fuel to create the combustible mixture that powers the engine. If the carburetor is dirty or clogged, it won’t be able to deliver the correct mixture, causing the mower to stall. This is a very common issue, especially if the mower has been sitting unused for a period.

A partially clogged carburetor is often the reason a lawn mower starts but won’t stay running. You can try using a carburetor cleaner spray to dissolve any deposits.  For more stubborn clogs, you may need to disassemble the carburetor and clean it thoroughly.  There are many helpful videos online demonstrating [how to clean a lawn mower carburetor without removing](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-lawn-mower-carburetor-without-removing) it. If you're not comfortable disassembling the carburetor, it’s best to take it to a qualified repair technician.

## 4. Spark Plug Issues: Ensuring Ignition

The spark plug ignites the air-fuel mixture in the engine. A faulty spark plug can cause intermittent stalling or prevent the engine from running at all. A weak or dirty spark plug won’t consistently ignite the fuel, leading to the engine shutting down.

To check the spark plug, disconnect the spark plug wire and remove the spark plug using a spark plug wrench. Inspect the spark plug for signs of fouling (carbon buildup) or damage. Clean the spark plug with a wire brush or replace it if it’s damaged.  You can also test the spark plug by connecting it to the spark plug wire and grounding the metal body of the plug against the engine block. Pull the starter cord and look for a strong, blue spark. If there’s no spark, or the spark is weak and orange, replace the spark plug.  Learn more about [how to clean a lawn mower spark plug](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-lawn-mower-spark-plug).

## 5. Overheating: A Less Common, But Serious Problem

While less common, overheating can cause a Toro lawn mower to shut off. The engine has a cooling system to prevent it from getting too hot. If the cooling system isn’t working properly, the engine can overheat and shut down to prevent damage.

Check the cooling fins on the engine for debris, such as grass clippings or dirt. These fins need to be clear to allow for proper airflow.  Also, ensure the engine oil level is correct. Low oil levels can contribute to overheating. If the mower continues to overheat, there may be a problem with the cooling fan or the cylinder head gasket, requiring professional repair.

## 6. Low Oil Shut-Off Sensor

Many Toro lawn mowers are equipped with a low oil shut-off sensor. This safety feature prevents the engine from running when the oil level is too low, protecting it from damage. If the oil level is low, the sensor will automatically shut off the engine.

Check the oil level using the dipstick. If the oil level is low, add the recommended type of oil to bring it up to the proper level.  Be sure to check the oil level before each use to prevent this issue.

## 7. Running Out of Gas After Running Out

Sometimes, a lawn mower will start and run briefly after running out of gas, but then die. This happens because there's still some fuel left in the carburetor bowl. However, once that small amount of fuel is used up, the engine will stall. If you suspect this is the case, try adding fuel and see if the mower runs longer. If you've recently run out of gas, you might need to prime the carburetor several times to get it started again.

## FAQ: Common Questions About Toro Lawn Mowers

**Q: Why does my Toro lawn mower start then die immediately?**

A: This often indicates a fuel delivery problem, such as a clogged fuel filter or a dirty carburetor. It could also be a spark plug issue, preventing consistent ignition.

**Q: How often should I change the spark plug on my Toro lawn mower?**

A: Generally, you should replace the spark plug every 100 hours of use or annually, whichever comes first.

**Q: What type of fuel should I use in my Toro lawn mower?**

A: Use fresh, unleaded gasoline with an octane rating of 87 or higher. It’s also recommended to use a fuel stabilizer, especially if you’re storing the mower for an extended period.

**Q: Can I use carburetor cleaner in my gas tank?**

A: While you can add a small amount of carburetor cleaner to the gas tank as a preventative measure, it’s generally more effective to use carburetor cleaner directly on the carburetor for cleaning purposes.



## Conclusion

A Toro lawn mower that won’t stay running can be a real headache, but with a little troubleshooting, you can often identify and fix the problem yourself.
