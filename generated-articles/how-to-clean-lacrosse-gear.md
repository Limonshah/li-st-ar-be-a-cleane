## Keeping Your Game Fresh: How To Clean Lacrosse Gear

Ever wonder how to properly care for your lacrosse gear? Lacrosse is a fantastic sport, but it can be tough on equipment. Dirt, sweat, and impact all take a toll, impacting performance and hygiene. This guide will walk you through how to clean lacrosse gear effectively, ensuring it lasts longer and keeps you playing your best. We’ll cover everything from your helmet and pads to your gloves and mesh, giving you a complete cleaning routine.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning extends the life of your gear.
*   Proper hygiene prevents odors and bacteria buildup.
*   Maintaining your equipment improves performance.

**Quick Answer:** Cleaning lacrosse gear involves removing dirt and debris with mild soap and water, disinfecting surfaces, and allowing everything to air dry completely. Focus on helmets, pads, gloves, and the mesh pocket of your stick for optimal performance and hygiene.

## 1. Cleaning Your Lacrosse Helmet: Safety First

Your lacrosse helmet is arguably the most important piece of equipment. It protects you from serious injury, so keeping it clean is vital. Start by removing the face mask and any cheek pads. These can be washed separately. Use a mild soap, like dish soap, and warm water to gently scrub the helmet shell. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the plastic. 

### Disinfecting Your Helmet

After washing, disinfecting is key. Bacteria can thrive in the dark, sweaty environment of a helmet. Use a sports equipment disinfectant spray, following the product’s instructions carefully.  Pay attention to the interior, as this is where sweat and bacteria accumulate.  For a deeper clean of the padding, consider a specialized helmet cleaner, but always check the manufacturer’s recommendations.

## 2. Washing Lacrosse Pads: Shoulder, Elbow, and More

Lacrosse pads, including shoulder, elbow, and knee pads, absorb a lot of sweat and impact.  Regular cleaning prevents odor and bacteria growth. Begin by loosening any straps and removing any removable padding. Hand wash the pads with mild soap and cool water. Avoid using a washing machine, as it can damage the padding and straps. 

### Drying Your Pads Properly

Air drying is crucial for lacrosse pads.  Direct sunlight can damage the materials, so dry them in a well-ventilated, shaded area. Ensure the pads are completely dry before storing them to prevent mildew.  Consider using a fan to speed up the drying process.  Proper drying is essential for maintaining the integrity of the padding.

## 3. Caring for Lacrosse Gloves: Maintaining Grip and Feel

Lacrosse gloves need special attention to maintain their grip and feel. After each use, wipe down the palms with a damp cloth to remove dirt and sweat. For a deeper clean, use a specialized lacrosse glove cleaner or a mild soap and water solution. Avoid soaking the gloves, as this can damage the leather or synthetic materials.

### Conditioning Your Gloves

Leather lacrosse gloves benefit from regular conditioning. This helps keep the leather supple and prevents cracking. Apply a leather conditioner specifically designed for sports equipment, following the product’s instructions.  Proper conditioning extends the life of your gloves and maintains their performance.

## 4. Cleaning Your Lacrosse Mesh: Pocket Perfection

The mesh pocket of your lacrosse stick is critical for ball control.  Dirt and debris can affect its performance. After each use, brush the mesh with a soft brush to remove loose dirt. For a more thorough cleaning, use a mesh cleaner specifically designed for lacrosse sticks.  Follow the product’s instructions carefully.

### Re-Waxing Your Mesh

After cleaning, re-waxing the mesh helps maintain its shape and performance. Use a lacrosse mesh wax, applying it evenly to the mesh. This creates a water-resistant barrier and improves ball retention.  Regular waxing ensures your pocket stays consistent and reliable.

## 5. Cleaning Lacrosse Protective Eyewear

Lacrosse eyewear, like goggles or shields, is essential for protecting your eyes. Clean them regularly with a microfiber cloth and a specialized lens cleaner. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials, as these can scratch the lenses. Inspect the eyewear for any damage before each use.

### Disinfecting Eyewear

Disinfecting your lacrosse eyewear is important to prevent the spread of bacteria. Use a sports equipment disinfectant spray, following the product’s instructions. Pay attention to the areas that come into contact with your face.  Ensure the eyewear is completely dry before storing it.

## 6. Cleaning Your Lacrosse Stick: Shaft and Handle Care

Your lacrosse stick’s shaft and handle also require cleaning. Wipe down the shaft with a damp cloth to remove dirt and grime. For stubborn stains, use a mild soap and water solution. Avoid using abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the finish. 

### Maintaining the Grip

The grip on your lacrosse stick is crucial for control. Clean it regularly with a damp cloth to remove sweat and dirt. If the grip becomes worn, replace it with a new one. A fresh grip improves your control and comfort.  You can also learn about cleaning other sporting equipment like [beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-backpack](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-backpack).

Proper storage is the final step in lacrosse gear maintenance. Always allow your gear to dry completely before storing it. Store your gear in a well-ventilated area to prevent mildew and odor. Consider using a gear bag specifically designed for lacrosse equipment.

### Long-Term Storage Tips

For long-term storage, remove any removable padding and wash it separately. Loosen any straps and buckles to prevent them from becoming damaged. Store your gear in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.
