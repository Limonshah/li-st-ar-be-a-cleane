*   Use mild soap and water for a deeper clean, and always dry thoroughly.
*   Store your necklace properly to prevent scratches and tarnishing.

## Understanding Your Kendra Scott Necklace Materials

Before you start cleaning, it’s important to know what your necklace is made of. Kendra Scott uses a variety of materials, including 14k gold plated brass, sterling silver, and semi-precious stones. Different materials require slightly different cleaning approaches. Knowing your necklace’s composition will help you choose the safest and most effective cleaning method. 

*   **Gold Plated Brass:** This is a common material, but the plating is delicate. Avoid harsh chemicals that can strip the gold.
*   **Sterling Silver:** Silver tarnishes easily, but can be polished to restore its shine.
*   **Semi-Precious Stones:** Some stones are more sensitive than others. Avoid prolonged soaking and abrasive cleaners.
*   **Delicate Stones/Pearls:** These require extra gentle handling and should ideally be cleaned by a professional.

## Daily Care: Preventing Buildup and Tarnishing

The best way to keep your Kendra Scott necklace clean is to prevent it from getting dirty in the first place. A little daily care can go a long way. This means removing your necklace before activities like showering, swimming, or exercising. These activities expose your jewelry to chemicals and abrasive elements that can damage the finish.

*   **Remove Before Activities:** Take off your necklace before showering, swimming, exercising, or applying lotions, perfumes, or hairspray.
*   **Wipe Down Regularly:** After each wear, gently wipe your necklace with a soft, lint-free cloth. This removes oils and dirt before they can build up.
*   **Avoid Direct Sunlight:** Prolonged exposure to sunlight can fade certain stones and discolor metals.

## Gentle Cleaning: Soap and Water Method

For a more thorough clean, a mild soap and water solution is your best bet. This method is safe for most Kendra Scott materials, but always test a small, inconspicuous area first. You’ll need a bowl of warm water, a few drops of mild dish soap (like Dawn), a soft toothbrush, and a clean, lint-free cloth. 

1.  **Prepare the Solution:** Mix warm water and a few drops of mild dish soap in a bowl.
2.  **Soak (Optional):** If your necklace is particularly dirty, you can soak it in the solution for a few minutes. *Avoid soaking necklaces with pearls or very delicate stones.*
3.  **Gently Scrub:** Use a soft toothbrush to gently scrub the necklace, paying attention to crevices and hard-to-reach areas.
4.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse the necklace thoroughly under warm, running water.
5.  **Dry Completely:** Pat the necklace dry with a clean, lint-free cloth. Ensure it's completely dry before storing.

## Dealing with Tarnished Sterling Silver

If your Kendra Scott necklace features sterling silver, you may notice it tarnishing over time. Tarnishing is a natural process, but it can be easily reversed. A silver polishing cloth is the easiest way to remove tarnish. Gently rub the cloth over the tarnished areas until the shine is restored. 

*   **Silver Polishing Cloth:** These cloths are specifically designed to remove tarnish without damaging the silver.
*   **Silver Polish (Use with Caution):** If the tarnish is severe, you can use a silver polish, but be sure to follow the instructions carefully and avoid getting it on any stones.
*   **Avoid Abrasive Cleaners:** Never use abrasive cleaners on sterling silver, as they can scratch the surface.

## Caring for Delicate Stones and Pearls

Kendra Scott necklaces often feature delicate stones and pearls, which require extra care. These materials are more susceptible to damage from harsh chemicals and abrasive cleaners. Avoid using any harsh cleaning solutions on these pieces. Instead, gently wipe them with a soft, damp cloth.

*   **Avoid Soaking:** Never soak necklaces with pearls or delicate stones in water.
*   **Gentle Wiping:** Use a soft, damp cloth to gently wipe the stones and pearls.
*   **Professional Cleaning:** For valuable or particularly delicate pieces, consider professional cleaning.
*   Remember to handle these materials with care, as they are more fragile than other materials.

## Proper Storage: Protecting Your Investment

How you store your Kendra Scott necklace is just as important as how you clean it. Proper storage prevents scratches, tarnishing, and other damage. Always store your necklace in a soft pouch or jewelry box, away from direct sunlight and humidity.

*   **Individual Pouches:** Store each necklace in its own soft pouch to prevent scratching.
*   **Jewelry Box:** A jewelry box with separate compartments is ideal for organizing and protecting your collection.
*   **Avoid Humidity:** Store your necklace in a dry place to prevent tarnishing.
*   **Keep Away from Sunlight:** Prolonged exposure to sunlight can fade certain stones and discolor metals.
*   You can also consider cleaning the area where you store your jewelry, like a [how to clean home](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-home) guide can help.
