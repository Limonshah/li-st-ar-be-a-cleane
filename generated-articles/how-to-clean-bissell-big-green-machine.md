## Keeping Your Floors Fresh: How To Clean a Bissell Big Green Machine

Is your Bissell Big Green Machine losing its cleaning power? Don't worry, a little maintenance can go a long way! This guide will walk you through a complete cleaning process for your machine, ensuring it continues to deliver sparkling clean floors for years to come. We’ll cover everything from emptying tanks to deep cleaning the internal components of your Bissell Big Green Machine. Let's get started and restore your carpet cleaner to its optimal performance.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly empty and clean both the clean and dirty water tanks.
*   Flush the machine with clean water after each use.
*   Deep clean the brush roll and hoses to remove stubborn debris.
*   Descale the machine periodically to prevent mineral buildup.

**Quick Answer:** To clean your Bissell Big Green Machine, empty and rinse both tanks, flush the system with clean water, clean the brush roll, and inspect/clean the hoses. Regular maintenance extends the life and effectiveness of your machine.

## 1. Initial Cleanup: Emptying and Rinsing the Tanks

After each use, the first step in cleaning your Bissell Big Green Machine is to empty and rinse both the clean and dirty water tanks. Leaving dirty water sitting in the tanks can lead to unpleasant odors and bacterial growth. Start by removing both tanks from the machine – they’re designed for easy removal.  Pour out the dirty water, being careful not to spill, and rinse the tank thoroughly with warm water. Repeat this process with the clean water tank, ensuring all traces of cleaning solution are removed.

## 2. Flushing the System with Clean Water

Flushing the system with clean water is crucial for removing any remaining detergent or debris from the internal components. Fill the clean water tank with fresh, warm water. Turn on your Bissell Big Green Machine and run it for approximately 30-60 seconds, spraying the water onto an old towel or directly into a drain. This process helps to clear out any lingering residue within the hoses and spray nozzles.  You can repeat this process a couple of times to ensure a thorough flush.

## 3. Cleaning the Brush Roll: Removing Hair and Debris

The brush roll is the workhorse of your Bissell Big Green Machine, and it often accumulates hair, fibers, and other debris. A clogged brush roll significantly reduces cleaning effectiveness.  Turn off and unplug the machine before attempting to clean the brush roll. Locate the brush roll access panel (refer to your machine’s manual for specific instructions). Carefully remove the brush roll and use scissors or a seam ripper to cut away any tangled hair or fibers.  You can also use a vacuum cleaner with a hose attachment to remove loose debris. 

## 4. Inspecting and Cleaning the Hoses

The hoses connecting the tanks to the machine can become clogged or harbor mildew over time. Regularly inspecting and cleaning these hoses is essential for maintaining optimal suction and spray power. Detach the hoses from both the machine and the tanks.  Visually inspect the hoses for any blockages or signs of mildew. If you find a blockage, use a long, flexible brush or a straightened coat hanger to gently dislodge it.  Rinse the hoses thoroughly with warm water and allow them to air dry completely before reattaching.

## 5. Deep Cleaning: Descaling Your Bissell Big Green Machine

Over time, mineral deposits from hard water can build up inside your Bissell Big Green Machine, reducing its performance. Descaling removes these deposits and keeps your machine running smoothly.  Mix a descaling solution (you can use a commercially available descaler or a mixture of equal parts white vinegar and water) according to the product instructions. Pour the solution into the clean water tank. Run the machine for approximately 10-15 minutes, allowing the solution to circulate through the system.  Afterward, flush the system thoroughly with clean water, repeating the flushing process described in section 2.

## 6. Exterior Cleaning and Storage

Don't forget to clean the exterior of your Bissell Big Green Machine! Wipe down the machine's housing with a damp cloth and mild detergent. Avoid using abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the plastic.  Pay attention to the power switch, handle, and tank compartments.  Once clean and dry, store your Bissell Big Green Machine in a cool, dry place. Proper storage helps to prevent mildew and prolong the life of your machine.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

Even with regular cleaning, you might encounter some common issues with your Bissell Big Green Machine. Here are a few troubleshooting tips:

*   **Low Suction:** Check the brush roll for clogs, inspect the hoses for blockages, and ensure the dirty water tank isn’t full.
*   **No Spray:** Verify that the clean water tank is filled, check the spray nozzles for clogs, and ensure the hoses are properly connected.
*   **Unpleasant Odor:** Thoroughly clean and disinfect both tanks, and run a flushing cycle with a descaling solution.
*   **Machine Not Turning On:** Check the power cord and outlet, and consult your machine’s manual for troubleshooting steps.
