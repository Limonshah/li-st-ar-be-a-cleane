## Keeping Your Engine Breathing: How to Clean An AEM Air Filter

Have you noticed a slight dip in your engine’s performance? It might be time to check your air filter. A clean air filter is crucial for optimal engine function, and if you have an AEM air filter, knowing how to properly clean it can save you money and ensure your vehicle continues to run smoothly. This guide will walk you through the entire process of cleaning your AEM air filter, from gathering supplies to re-oiling and reinstalling. We’ll cover everything you need to know to maintain your filter and keep your engine breathing easy.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning extends the life of your AEM air filter.
*   Proper cleaning maintains optimal airflow for engine performance.
*   Re-oiling is essential after cleaning to trap dirt effectively.

**Quick Answer:** To clean an AEM air filter, gently remove it from the intake, spray with AEM Air Filter Cleaner, allow to dry, then evenly apply AEM Air Filter Oil. Reinstall once the oil is tacky, ensuring proper sealing for optimal engine performance.

## Understanding Your AEM Air Filter

AEM air filters are known for their high flow and excellent filtration capabilities. Unlike disposable paper filters, AEM filters are designed to be cleaned and reused, making them a cost-effective and environmentally friendly choice. These filters typically use a multi-layered cotton gauze material that effectively traps dirt and debris. Understanding the filter’s construction is the first step to properly maintaining it. 

There are different types of AEM filters, but the cleaning process remains largely the same. Knowing whether you have a Dryflow filter or a pre-oiled filter will help you determine the best cleaning approach. You can find more information about cleaning frequency for AEM Dryflow filters [here](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-often-to-clean-aem-dryflow-filter).  Regular inspection is key; check your filter every service or approximately every 25,000 miles, depending on driving conditions.

## Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Before you begin, you’ll need to gather a few essential supplies. Having everything ready will make the cleaning process much smoother and more efficient. Don’t skip this step, as using the wrong products can damage your filter.

Here’s what you’ll need:

*   **AEM Air Filter Cleaner:** Specifically designed for AEM filters.
*   **AEM Air Filter Oil:**  Essential for re-oiling the filter after cleaning.
*   **Soft Brush:** A soft-bristled brush (like a paintbrush) to loosen dirt.
*   **Clean Water:** For rinsing the filter.
*   **Clean Rags:** For wiping and drying.
*   **Gloves:** To protect your hands.
*   **Well-Ventilated Area:**  To work in.



## The Cleaning Process: Step-by-Step

Now that you have your supplies, let's get to the cleaning process. This is where you’ll remove the dirt and debris that have accumulated in your filter. Remember to be gentle throughout the process to avoid damaging the delicate filter material.

1.  **Remove the Filter:** Carefully remove the AEM air filter from your vehicle’s air intake system.
2.  **Apply Cleaner:** Generously spray the entire filter with AEM Air Filter Cleaner, ensuring complete coverage.
3.  **Let it Soak:** Allow the cleaner to soak into the filter for at least 10-20 minutes. This helps to loosen the dirt and grime.
4.  **Gentle Brushing:** Use a soft brush to gently loosen any remaining dirt. Brush in the direction of the filter pleats.
5.  **Rinse with Water:** Rinse the filter with *low-pressure* water, again brushing gently in the direction of the pleats. Avoid high-pressure water, as it can damage the filter.
6.  **Dry Thoroughly:** Allow the filter to air dry completely. *Do not use compressed air or a heat source to speed up the drying process.* This can damage the filter material.

## Re-Oiling Your AEM Air Filter

Once the filter is completely dry, it’s time to re-oil it. This is a crucial step, as the oil helps to trap dirt and debris, ensuring your engine remains protected. Without oil, the filter won’t function effectively.

1.  **Apply Oil Evenly:**  Spray AEM Air Filter Oil evenly across the entire filter surface. Focus on getting oil into the pleats.
2.  **Massage the Oil:** Gently massage the oil into the filter material, ensuring complete coverage.
3.  **Allow to Soak:** Let the oil soak into the filter for at least 20-30 minutes. This allows the oil to distribute evenly.
4.  **Check for Saturation:** The filter should be evenly red and slightly tacky to the touch. If any areas appear dry, apply more oil.  Avoid over-oiling, as this can cause issues with your mass airflow sensor.

## Reinstallation and Ongoing Maintenance

With your AEM air filter cleaned and re-oiled, it’s ready to be reinstalled. Proper installation ensures a tight seal and optimal airflow. 

1.  **Reinstall the Filter:** Carefully reinstall the filter into your vehicle’s air intake system, ensuring a secure fit.
2.  **Check the Seal:** Double-check that the filter is properly sealed to prevent unfiltered air from entering the engine.
3.  **Regular Inspections:** Continue to inspect your filter regularly, cleaning it as needed.  Consider how often you should clean your cold air intake filter based on your driving conditions [here](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-often-to-clean-the-cold-air-intake-filter).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
