## Keeping Your Floors Sparkling: How To Clean a Bissell Crosswave Tray

Is your Bissell Crosswave leaving streaks or smelling a little funky? Often, the culprit isn’t the machine itself, but a dirty cleaning tray. A clean tray ensures fresh water and cleaning solution are distributed evenly, giving you the spotless floors you desire. This guide will walk you through exactly how to clean your Bissell Crosswave tray, keeping it in top condition for years to come. We’ll cover everything from quick rinses to deep cleaning, ensuring your floors always look their best.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly empty and rinse the tray after each use.
*   Deep clean the tray weekly with mild soap and water.
*   Inspect and clean the filter screen within the tray.
*   Ensure the tray is completely dry before reassembling.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean your Bissell Crosswave tray, simply empty any remaining dirty water, remove the filter screen, rinse the tray with warm water, and scrub with mild dish soap if needed.  Rinse thoroughly and allow to air dry completely before reassembling.

## Why Cleaning the Bissell Crosswave Tray Matters

The Bissell Crosswave is a fantastic machine for cleaning hard floors, but it relies on a clean system to function properly. The tray is where dirty water and debris collect, and if left uncleaned, it can harbor bacteria, mold, and unpleasant odors. This can then be redistributed onto your floors, defeating the purpose of cleaning! Regularly cleaning the tray prevents buildup, maintains suction power, and ensures your floors get a truly clean finish.  Plus, a well-maintained Crosswave will last longer, saving you money in the long run.

## Emptying and Rinsing After Every Use

The simplest, yet most important step, is emptying and rinsing the tray after *every* use. This prevents grime from hardening and makes deeper cleaning much easier. After finishing your floor cleaning, remove the dirty water tank and pour out the contents.  Then, rinse the tray thoroughly with warm water, removing any visible debris.  Don't forget to check for hair or larger particles that might be stuck in the corners.  This quick routine takes less than a minute and significantly extends the life of your machine.

## Deep Cleaning the Crosswave Tray: A Step-by-Step Guide

While rinsing is essential, a weekly deep clean is crucial for maintaining optimal hygiene. Here’s how to do it:

1.  **Empty and Rinse:** Begin by emptying any remaining water and rinsing the tray with warm water.
2.  **Remove the Filter Screen:** Carefully remove the filter screen from the tray. This screen catches larger debris, so it needs regular attention.
3.  **Wash with Soap and Water:** Fill the tray with warm water and add a small amount of mild dish soap. Gently scrub the inside of the tray with a soft sponge or cloth. Avoid abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the plastic.
4.  **Clean the Filter Screen:** Rinse the filter screen under running water, removing any trapped dirt or debris. You can use a soft brush to gently scrub it if needed.
5.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse both the tray and the filter screen thoroughly with clean water, ensuring all soap residue is removed.
6.  **Air Dry Completely:** Allow both the tray and the filter screen to air dry completely before reassembling.  Never reassemble with wet parts, as this can promote mold growth.

## Cleaning the Filter Screen: Preventing Clogs and Maintaining Suction

The filter screen within the Bissell Crosswave tray plays a vital role in preventing clogs and maintaining suction. A clogged filter screen reduces the machine’s effectiveness and can even damage the motor. Regularly cleaning the filter screen is therefore essential.  If you notice reduced suction, the filter screen is likely the first place to check.  Consider replacing the filter screen every few months, depending on usage, to ensure optimal performance.

## Dealing with Stubborn Stains and Odors

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, stubborn stains or odors can linger in the Crosswave tray. Here are a few solutions:

*   **Vinegar Soak:** For tough stains, fill the tray with a solution of equal parts white vinegar and water. Let it soak for 30 minutes, then scrub and rinse thoroughly.
*   **Baking Soda Paste:** For odors, make a paste of baking soda and water. Apply it to the affected areas, let it sit for 15 minutes, then scrub and rinse.
*   **Hydrogen Peroxide:** For disinfecting, you can use a diluted hydrogen peroxide solution (3% hydrogen peroxide mixed with water).  Be sure to rinse extremely well after using hydrogen peroxide.

Always test any cleaning solution in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t damage the plastic.

## Preventing Future Buildup and Maintaining Your Crosswave

Preventing buildup is always easier than cleaning it up! Here are a few tips to keep your Bissell Crosswave tray clean and functioning optimally:

*   **Use Bissell Cleaning Solutions:** Using genuine Bissell cleaning solutions is recommended, as they are formulated to work with the machine and minimize residue buildup.
*   **Rinse After Every Use:** As mentioned before, rinsing the tray after every use is the single most effective preventative measure.
*   **Regular Deep Cleaning:** Stick to a weekly deep cleaning schedule to prevent grime from accumulating.
*   **Store Properly:** When not in use, store your Crosswave in a clean, dry place.  This prevents mold and mildew growth.
*   **Consider Water Quality:** Hard water can contribute to mineral buildup. If you have hard water, consider using distilled water in your Crosswave.
