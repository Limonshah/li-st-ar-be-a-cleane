## Keeping Your RV Shower Fresh: How To Clean a Plastic RV Shower

Is your RV shower looking a little worse for wear? Don't worry, it's a common problem! RV showers, especially those made of plastic, can quickly accumulate grime, soap scum, and even mildew. Fortunately, cleaning a plastic RV shower doesn’t have to be a daunting task. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to restore your RV shower to its sparkling best. We’ll cover the best cleaning solutions, techniques, and preventative measures to keep it looking great for years to come.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning prevents buildup.
*   Mild cleaners are best for plastic surfaces.
*   Ventilation is key to preventing mildew.
*   Proper rinsing avoids residue.

**Quick Answer:** To clean a plastic RV shower, mix a mild dish soap with warm water, scrub with a soft sponge or brush, rinse thoroughly, and dry with a microfiber cloth. For tougher stains, use a solution of baking soda and water or a commercial RV shower cleaner specifically designed for plastic.

## 1. Understanding Your RV Shower Material

Before diving into cleaning, it’s important to understand what your RV shower is made of. Most RV showers are constructed from acrylic or fiberglass, both types of plastic. Knowing this helps you choose the right cleaning products. Harsh chemicals can damage these surfaces, causing discoloration or even cracking. Always test any new cleaner in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t cause any adverse reactions.  You want to maintain the integrity of your shower for long-term use.

## 2. Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Having the right tools makes the job much easier. You don’t need a ton of fancy equipment, just a few essentials. Here’s a checklist of what you’ll need to effectively clean your plastic RV shower:

*   Mild dish soap
*   Warm water
*   Soft sponge or microfiber cloth
*   Spray bottle
*   Baking soda
*   White vinegar (optional, for tougher stains)
*   RV-specific shower cleaner (optional)
*   Old toothbrush (for grout and tight spaces)
*   Rubber gloves (to protect your hands)

Consider keeping a dedicated set of cleaning supplies specifically for your RV to avoid cross-contamination with household cleaners.  This will help ensure you're always using products safe for your RV's surfaces.

## 3. The Daily & Weekly Cleaning Routine

Consistency is key when it comes to RV shower maintenance. A quick daily wipe-down after each use can prevent soap scum and mildew from building up. For a more thorough cleaning, aim for a weekly routine. 

*   **Daily:** Spray the shower walls with water after each use and wipe down with a microfiber cloth.
*   **Weekly:** Mix a few drops of mild dish soap with warm water in a spray bottle. Spray the entire shower surface and let it sit for a few minutes. Scrub gently with a soft sponge or cloth, paying attention to areas prone to buildup. Rinse thoroughly with clean water and dry with a microfiber cloth.  Don't forget to check the [shower drain](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hair-from-shower-drain) for hair and debris.

## 4. Tackling Tough Stains and Mildew

Sometimes, a simple soap and water solution isn’t enough.  Stubborn stains and mildew require a little extra effort. Here are a few effective methods:

*   **Baking Soda Paste:** Mix baking soda with a small amount of water to form a paste. Apply the paste to stained areas and let it sit for 15-20 minutes. Scrub gently with a sponge or toothbrush and rinse thoroughly.
*   **Vinegar Solution:**  Mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Spray the solution onto mildewed areas and let it sit for 30 minutes. Scrub with a brush and rinse well. *Always test vinegar in an inconspicuous area first.*
*   **Commercial RV Shower Cleaner:** If you prefer a commercial product, choose one specifically designed for RV showers and plastic surfaces. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully.

## 5. Cleaning the Shower Walls and Floor

The walls and floor of your RV shower require slightly different approaches.  Shower walls are generally smoother and easier to clean. The floor, however, may have textured surfaces or grout lines that trap dirt and grime.

*   **Shower Walls:** Use the methods described above (soap and water, baking soda paste, or vinegar solution) to clean the walls. Pay attention to corners and areas around fixtures.
*   **Shower Floor:** For textured floors, use a scrub brush with stiff bristles to dislodge dirt and grime. For grout lines, use an old toothbrush and a grout cleaner or baking soda paste.  Consider using a product designed for [cleaning the bottom of a shower](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bottom-of-shower) for a deeper clean.

## 6. Preventing Future Buildup and Mildew

Prevention is always better than cure.  Here are a few tips to keep your RV shower clean and fresh:

*   **Ventilation:**  Always run the RV’s exhaust fan during and after showering to remove moisture.
*   **Squeegee:** Use a squeegee to remove excess water from the shower walls after each use.
*   **Regular Cleaning:** Stick to a regular cleaning schedule to prevent buildup.
*   **Avoid Harsh Chemicals:**  Stick to mild cleaners specifically designed for plastic surfaces.
*   **Dry Storage:** Ensure all shower products are stored in a dry place when not in use.

## 7. Maintaining Your RV Shower’s Appearance

Beyond cleaning, a little maintenance can go a long way in preserving your RV shower’s appearance. Inspect the caulking around the shower regularly for cracks or damage.  Replace damaged caulking to prevent water leaks.  Also, consider applying a plastic protectant to the shower walls to help repel water and stains.
