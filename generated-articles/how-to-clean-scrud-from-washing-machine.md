## Is That Slimy Stuff in Your Washer? How to Clean Scrud From Your Washing Machine

Have you noticed a black, gooey, or slimy residue in your washing machine? That’s likely scud – a frustrating buildup of fabric softener, detergent, dirt, and body oils. It’s not mold, though it’s often mistaken for it, and it can leave your clothes smelling less than fresh. Don't worry, getting rid of scud is achievable with the right approach. This article will guide you through identifying scud, effectively cleaning it from your washing machine, and preventing its return, ensuring your laundry always comes out sparkling clean.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning cycles with hot water and vinegar are key.
*   Use the correct amount of high-efficiency (HE) detergent.
*   Avoid excessive fabric softener.
*   Leave the washing machine door ajar to allow for ventilation.

**What Exactly *Is* Scud in Your Washing Machine?**

Scud isn’t a fungus or mold, but a harmless byproduct of laundry. It forms when insoluble ingredients from detergents, fabric softeners, body oils, and dirt combine within your washing machine. This mixture creates a slimy, grayish-black residue that clings to the drum, seals, and dispenser drawers. While not harmful to your health, scud can cause unpleasant odors and reduce your washing machine’s efficiency. 

## Identifying Scud: What Does It Look Like?

Before you start cleaning, it’s important to confirm you’re dealing with scud and not mold. Scud typically appears as a grayish-black, slimy film. It’s often found around the detergent dispenser, the rubber gasket (on front-load washers), and the bottom of the drum. Unlike mold, scud doesn’t usually have a strong, musty odor. If you're unsure, it's always a good idea to check for mold as well. You can find more information on [how to clean mold from washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-from-washing-machine) to be sure.  If you see visible mold, address that first before tackling the scud.

## The Best Way to Clean Scud From Your Washing Machine

Cleaning scud requires a bit of elbow grease, but it’s a manageable task. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Wipe Down Surfaces:** Start by wiping down all accessible surfaces inside the washing machine with a damp cloth. Focus on the detergent dispenser, the rubber gasket (if applicable), and the inside of the drum.
2.  **Hot Water Cycle with Vinegar:** Run an empty washing machine cycle on the hottest water setting. Add 2-4 cups of white vinegar directly into the drum. Vinegar helps to dissolve the scud buildup.
3.  **Second Hot Water Cycle with Baking Soda:** After the vinegar cycle, run another empty hot water cycle. This time, add ½ cup of baking soda to the detergent dispenser. Baking soda helps to neutralize odors and further loosen any remaining scud.
4.  **Clean the Dispenser Drawers:** Remove the detergent and fabric softener dispenser drawers. Soak them in a solution of warm water and dish soap for at least 30 minutes. Scrub away any scud residue with a brush before rinsing and drying thoroughly.
5.  **Wipe Again:** After the cycles are complete, wipe down all surfaces again with a clean, damp cloth. You should notice a significant reduction in the scud buildup.

## Preventing Scud Buildup: Long-Term Maintenance

Preventing scud is easier than removing it! Here are some tips to keep your washing machine scud-free:

*   **Use HE Detergent:** Always use high-efficiency (HE) detergent in HE washing machines. Regular detergents produce too many suds, contributing to scud formation.
*   **Use the Right Amount of Detergent:** More detergent doesn’t mean cleaner clothes. Follow the detergent manufacturer’s instructions carefully. Overusing detergent is a major cause of scud.
*   **Limit Fabric Softener:** Fabric softener is a primary contributor to scud. Consider reducing your usage or switching to dryer sheets instead.
*   **Leave the Door Ajar:** After each wash, leave the washing machine door slightly ajar to allow for ventilation. This helps to prevent moisture buildup, which can contribute to scud formation.
*   **Regular Cleaning:** Run a cleaning cycle with vinegar or a washing machine cleaner at least once a month.  Understanding [how to use a washing machine](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-use-a-washing-machine) properly, including its cleaning cycles, is crucial.

## Cleaning Specific Washing Machine Types

Different washing machine types may require slightly different cleaning approaches.

*   **Top-Load Washers:** Top-load washers are generally less prone to scud buildup due to their design. However, you should still follow the cleaning steps outlined above. Pay close attention to the agitator, cleaning it regularly to remove any trapped residue. You can find more information on [how to clean agitator in washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-agitator-in-washing-machine).
*   **Front-Load Washers:** Front-load washers are more susceptible to scud buildup due to their rubber gasket and lower water usage. Be sure to thoroughly clean the gasket after each wash and run regular cleaning cycles.
*   **Specific Brands:** Cleaning a [Samsung washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-samsung-washing-machine), a [GE washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-ge-washing-machine), or a [Frigidaire washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-frigidaire-washing-machine) might have specific instructions. Always refer to your washing machine’s manual for the most accurate guidance.
