## 1. Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Before you begin, having the right tools makes all the difference. You’ll need a few essential items to effectively clean your Subaru’s cloth seats. This preparation will streamline the process and ensure a thorough clean. 

Here’s what you’ll need:

*   Vacuum cleaner with upholstery attachment
*   Upholstery cleaner (specifically for cloth)

## 2. The Importance of Vacuuming

Vacuuming is the first and most crucial step in cleaning your Subaru cloth seats. It removes loose dirt, dust, and debris that can hinder the effectiveness of cleaning solutions. Don't skip this step, as it sets the foundation for a truly clean result.

Here’s how to vacuum effectively:

*   Use the upholstery attachment on your vacuum.
*   Vacuum the entire seat surface, including crevices and seams.
*   Pay special attention to areas where dirt accumulates, like under the seat and along the edges.
*   For stubborn debris, use a soft-bristled brush to loosen it before vacuuming.

A thorough vacuuming prevents you from grinding dirt into the fabric when you start cleaning. If you're also looking to clean seats in another vehicle, you might find this article on [how to clean Honda Civic cloth seats](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-honda-civic-cloth-seats) helpful.

## 3. Tackling Tough Stains

Stains are inevitable, especially with regular use. Addressing them promptly is key to preventing them from becoming permanent. Different stains require different approaches, so identifying the stain type is important.

Here’s how to tackle common stains:

*   **Food and Drink:** Blot immediately with a clean cloth. Use an upholstery cleaner specifically designed for food and drink stains.
*   **Oil-Based Stains:** Apply a small amount of dish soap to the stain, gently scrub, and blot with a clean cloth.
*   **Mud:** Allow the mud to dry completely, then vacuum. If a stain remains, use an upholstery cleaner.
*   **Ink:** Dab the stain with rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball, then blot with a clean cloth.

Always test any cleaning solution in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t damage the fabric. You can also find helpful tips on cleaning car interiors in this article about [how to clean in-between car seats](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-in-between-car-seats).

## 4. Deep Cleaning Your Subaru’s Cloth Seats

Once you’ve vacuumed and treated any stains, it’s time for a deep clean. This will refresh the entire seat surface and remove embedded dirt and grime. Remember to work in sections to prevent the cleaner from drying on the fabric.

Here’s how to deep clean:

*   Mix a small amount of upholstery cleaner with warm water according to the product instructions.
*   Pour the solution into a spray bottle.
*   Lightly spray the solution onto the seat fabric.
*   Gently scrub the fabric with a soft-bristled brush or a microfiber cloth.
*   Avoid saturating the fabric.

## 5. Rinsing and Drying

After cleaning, it’s essential to rinse away any remaining cleaning solution. Leaving residue can attract dirt and leave your seats feeling sticky. Proper drying is also crucial to prevent mold and mildew growth.

Here’s how to rinse and dry:

*   Dampen a clean microfiber cloth with warm water.
*   Wipe down the seat surface to remove any remaining cleaning solution.
*   Repeat with a fresh cloth until no more residue is visible.
*   Open the car windows and doors to allow for air circulation.
*   Allow the seats to dry completely before using the vehicle.

You can also use a fan to speed up the drying process. Be patient and ensure the seats are completely dry to avoid any issues.

## 6. Protecting Your Clean Seats

Now that your Subaru’s cloth seats are clean, it’s important to protect them from future stains and wear. Regular maintenance will keep them looking their best for years to come.

Here are some protective measures:

*   **Seat Covers:** Consider using seat covers, especially if you frequently transport passengers or pets.
*   **Regular Vacuuming:** Vacuum your seats at least once a week to remove loose dirt and debris.
*   **Prompt Stain Treatment:** Address stains immediately to prevent them from setting.
*   **Fabric Protector:** Apply a fabric protector spray to help repel stains and water.

Taking these steps will help maintain the cleanliness and appearance of your Subaru’s cloth seats. If you have leather seats in another vehicle, you might find this guide on [how to clean Mercedes leather seats](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mercedes-leather-seats) useful.

## 7. Dealing with Specific Subaru Seat Materials

Subaru often uses different cloth materials depending on the model and trim level. Knowing your seat material can help you choose the right cleaning products and techniques.

*   **Standard Cloth:** Most Subaru models come with a durable, standard cloth that responds well to the cleaning methods outlined above.
*   **StarTex:** Some Subaru models feature StarTex, a water-repellent and stain-resistant fabric. This material is easier to clean and requires less aggressive cleaning solutions.
