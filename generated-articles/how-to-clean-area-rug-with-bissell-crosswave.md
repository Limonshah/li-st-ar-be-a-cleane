**Can you use a Bissell Crosswave on area rugs?**

## 1. Preparing Your Area Rug for a Deep Clean

Before you even think about turning on your Bissell Crosswave, preparation is key. A thorough pre-cleaning routine will make the actual cleaning process much more effective. Start by removing all furniture from the rug. This gives you unobstructed access to the entire surface. Next, give the rug a good vacuuming. 

Vacuuming removes loose dirt, dust, and debris, preventing them from turning into mud during the wet cleaning process. Pay special attention to high-traffic areas and edges, where dirt tends to accumulate. For a deeper clean before using the Crosswave, consider using a [Bissell Quicksteamer](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-bissell-quicksteamer) for a preliminary steam clean. This can loosen stubborn dirt and prepare the fibers for the Crosswave’s cleaning action.

## 2. Choosing the Right Cleaning Solution

Selecting the correct cleaning solution is crucial for protecting your area rug. Different rug materials require different approaches. Always check the rug’s care label for specific instructions. For most synthetic rugs, the Bissell Multi-Surface Pet Cleaning Solution works well. 

However, for delicate rugs like wool or silk, you might need a specialized rug cleaner. Avoid using harsh chemicals or excessive amounts of detergent, as these can damage the fibers or leave behind a sticky residue. If you're unsure, test the solution on an inconspicuous area of the rug first to ensure it doesn't cause discoloration or damage. You can also explore making your own gentle cleaning solution with water and a small amount of mild dish soap.

## 3. Utilizing Your Bissell Crosswave for Effective Rug Cleaning

Now for the main event! Fill the clean water tank of your Bissell Crosswave with the appropriate cleaning solution, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Select the appropriate setting on your Crosswave. For area rugs, the "Area Rug" setting is usually ideal, but you may need to adjust based on your rug’s pile height and material. 

Begin cleaning in overlapping strokes, moving slowly and steadily across the rug. The Crosswave’s brushroll will agitate the fibers, loosening dirt and stains, while the suction removes the dirty water. Pay extra attention to heavily soiled areas, making multiple passes as needed. Remember to empty and refill the dirty water tank as it becomes full.

## 4. Tackling Stubborn Stains on Your Rug

Even with regular cleaning, stubborn stains can appear on your area rug. The Bissell Crosswave can help, but you might need a slightly different approach. For fresh stains, blot (don't rub!) the area with a clean cloth to absorb as much liquid as possible. Then, apply a small amount of cleaning solution directly to the stain. 

Let it sit for a few minutes, then use the Crosswave’s edge cleaning mode to target the stain specifically. For older, set-in stains, you may need to repeat the process several times. If the stain persists, consider using a Bissell [Spotbot](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-use-bissell-spotbot) for targeted stain removal.

## 5. Drying Your Area Rug Properly

Proper drying is just as important as the cleaning process itself. A damp rug can attract dirt and mildew, negating all your hard work. After cleaning, use the Crosswave to extract as much excess water as possible. Then, allow the rug to air dry completely. 

This can take several hours, or even overnight, depending on the rug’s thickness and the humidity levels in your home. To speed up the drying process, you can use fans or open windows to improve air circulation. Avoid walking on the rug until it is completely dry. You might also consider using a dehumidifier to remove moisture from the air.

## 6. Rug Material Considerations & Specific Cleaning Tips

Different rug materials require slightly different care. Here's a quick guide:

*   **Synthetic Rugs (Polyester, Nylon):** These are generally the most durable and can withstand more aggressive cleaning. The Bissell Crosswave works well on these.
*   **Wool Rugs:** Wool is delicate and requires gentle cleaning. Use a wool-specific cleaning solution and avoid excessive moisture. Consider professional cleaning for valuable wool rugs.
*   **Natural Fiber Rugs (Jute, Sisal):** These rugs are sensitive to water and can easily become damaged. Vacuum regularly and spot clean only. You might want to explore cleaning options like [how to clean an outside rug](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-an-outside-rug).
*   **Viscose Rugs:** Viscose is prone to watermarks. Use a specialized viscose cleaner and avoid over-wetting. Check out [how to clean a viscose rug at home](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-viscose-rug-at-home) for more details.

## 7. Maintaining Your Rug’s Cleanliness

Regular maintenance is the best way to keep your area rug looking its best. Vacuum your rug at least once a week, and more often in high-traffic areas. Address spills and stains immediately to prevent them from setting. Consider using rug pads to protect your rug from wear and tear and to prevent slipping. Rotate your rug periodically to ensure even wear. With a little effort, you can keep your area rug clean, fresh, and beautiful for years to come.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can I use fabric softener in my Bissell Crosswave when cleaning area rugs?**

A: It’s generally not recommended to use fabric softener in your Bissell Crosswave. Fabric softener can leave a residue on the rug fibers, attracting dirt and reducing the rug’s ability to repel stains. Stick to the recommended cleaning solutions for optimal results.

**Q: How often should I clean my area rug with a Bissell Crosswave?**

A: The frequency of cleaning depends on foot traffic and usage. Generally, cleaning your area rug every 3-6 months is a good starting point. High-traffic areas may require more frequent cleaning.

**Q: What if my Bissell Crosswave isn’t picking up water when cleaning my rug?**

A: If your Crosswave isn’t picking up water, check the dirty water tank to ensure it’s not full. Also, inspect the filters and hoses for any clogs. You can find more troubleshooting tips at [bissell carpet cleaner not picking up water](https://www.beacleaner.com/bissell-carpet-cleaner-not-picking-up-water).

**Q: Is it safe to use a Bissell Crosswave on antique or delicate rugs?**

A: It’s generally not recommended to use a Bissell Crosswave on antique or very delicate rugs. These rugs may be damaged by the machine’s agitation and suction. Consider professional cleaning for these types of rugs.
