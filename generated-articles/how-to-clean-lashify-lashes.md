To clean Lashify lashes, gently remove them from your eyes. Then, soak them in a specialized cleaning solution or rubbing alcohol. Carefully pick off any bond residue with tweezers. Rinse the lashes and let them air dry fully on a clean surface.

### Why You Must Clean Your Lashify Lashes

Cleaning your Lashify lashes is very important. It keeps them hygienic and extends their use. Over time, makeup, oils, and the Lashify bond build up on the Gossamer lashes. This buildup can cause eye irritation or even infections. Keeping your lashes clean protects your eye health.

Clean lashes also look better. Buildup can make the lashes stiff or clumpy. This affects how they look when you wear them. When you clean Lashify lashes, they stay soft and fluffy. They will look fresh and new with each wear. This helps you get many uses from each Gossamer pair.

Not cleaning your lashes wastes your investment. Lashify Gossamers are reusable. Proper care means you buy fewer new pairs. This saves you money in the long run. Regular cleaning is a simple step. It protects your eyes, maintains the lash look, and saves you money.

### Essential Tools for Cleaning Lashify Lashes

Gathering the right tools before you start makes the cleaning process easy. You do not need many items to clean Lashify lashes. A few key products will do the trick. Having these items ready ensures a smooth and effective cleaning session.

First, you need a shallow dish or a small bowl. This is where you will soak your lashes. Make sure it is clean and wide enough for the Gossamers to lay flat. Next, you need a gentle cleaning solution. Lashify offers their own "Melt Away" or "Release" formulas. You can also use 91% or 70% isopropyl alcohol. Micellar water is another good option if it is oil-free.

You also need a pair of fine-tip tweezers. These are essential for picking off stubborn bond residue. Soft, lint-free pads or cotton swabs are useful for wiping. Some people like using a clean, soft spoolie brush. This can help gently comb through the lashes. Finally, a clean paper towel or a soft, dry cloth is needed for drying. Ensure all tools are clean before you begin.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Clean Lashify Lashes

Cleaning your Lashify Gossamers is simple when you follow clear steps. This method helps remove all residue. It also protects the delicate lash fibers. I find this process keeps my lashes looking fresh and ready for many wears.

**1. Remove Lashes Gently:**
Start by carefully removing the Gossamer lashes from your natural lashes. Use a small amount of Lashify's Melt Away or a gentle oil-based cleanser. Apply it to the bond line and wait a few seconds. This helps dissolve the bond. Gently slide the Gossamers off. Do not pull or tug on them. Handle them by the spine, not the delicate fibers.

**2. Prepare Cleaning Solution:**
Pour a small amount of your chosen cleaning solution into a shallow dish. This could be 91% isopropyl alcohol or an oil-free micellar water. Make sure there is just enough liquid to cover the lashes. Too much liquid is not needed.

**3. Soak the Lashes:**
Place the removed Gossamer lashes into the cleaning solution. Ensure they are fully submerged. Let them soak for 1-2 minutes. This soaking time helps soften the bond. It makes it easier to remove later. Avoid soaking for too long, as it is not necessary.

**4. Remove Bond Residue:**
After soaking, take one Gossamer out of the solution with your tweezers. Gently, starting from the base of the lash spine, peel or pick off any remaining bond residue. Work slowly and carefully. Do not pull on the lash fibers themselves. You want to remove only the hardened bond.

**5. Rinse Lashes:**
Once all bond is removed, rinse the Gossamer lashes. You can dip them in clean water or gently spray them. This removes any leftover cleaning solution. Ensure no sticky residue remains. This step is important for cleanliness.

**6. Final Inspection:**
Hold the cleaned lash up to the light. Look closely for any remaining bond or dirt. If you see anything, repeat the cleaning or picking step. The lashes should look clean and fluffy. They should not have any gummy parts.

### Dealing with Stubborn Lashify Bond Residue

Sometimes, the Lashify bond can be very stubborn. Even after soaking, some residue might stick firmly to the Gossamer spine. This is a common challenge for users. Do not get discouraged if you face this issue. There are ways to handle it without damaging your precious lashes.

First, try extending the soaking time slightly. If you usually soak for one minute, try two or three. Make sure the cleaning solution is strong enough, like 91% isopropyl alcohol. For more on cleaning different lash types, consider reading about [how to clean Glamnetic lashes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-glamnetic-lashes). This can help loosen the grip of the bond.

Next, use your fine-tip tweezers with precision. Instead of pulling, try to gently roll the bond off the spine. You can also try scraping it off very carefully. Imagine you are removing a tiny sticker. Apply very light pressure. Be sure to only target the bond and not the lash fibers. If the bond is still very difficult to remove, you can use a small amount of Lashify's Melt Away solution directly on a cotton swab. Gently rub the swab along the spine. This helps dissolve the most resistant areas. Patience is key when dealing with stubborn bond. It ensures your lashes remain intact and ready for future use.

### Drying and Storing Your Clean Lashify Lashes

Proper drying and storage are just as important as cleaning. These steps prevent mold or mildew growth. They also help your Lashify Gossamers maintain their shape. Rushing this part can shorten the lifespan of your lashes.

After cleaning and rinsing your Lashify lashes, place them on a clean, dry paper towel or lint-free cloth. Do not use a fuzzy towel. The fibers can stick to the lashes. Lay them flat and separate them slightly. This allows air to circulate around them.

Let the lashes air dry completely. This might take a few hours. Make sure they are completely dry before storing them. Any moisture can encourage bacteria growth. Never use heat, like a hairdryer, to speed up drying. Heat can warp the delicate fibers of the Gossamers. It can also melt the lash spine.

Once fully dry, place your clean Lashify lashes back into their original clear case. The case is designed to hold their shape. It also protects them from dust and damage. If you do not have the original case, use a small, clean, airtight container. Store the container in a cool, dry place. Avoid direct sunlight or humid areas. Proper storage keeps your Gossamers organized and ready for your next application.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid When Cleaning Lashify Lashes

Cleaning Lashify lashes can be tricky at first. Many common mistakes can damage your Gossamers. Knowing what not to do is as important as knowing what to do. Avoid these pitfalls to keep your lashes in top condition.

First, do not use harsh chemicals. Regular makeup removers or oil-based products can break down the lash fibers. They can also leave an oily residue. This residue makes it hard for the bond to stick later. Always use oil-free solutions or isopropyl alcohol.

Second, avoid excessive scrubbing or pulling. The Gossamer lashes are very delicate. Rough handling can bend the spine. It can also pull out the individual lash fibers. Use a gentle touch when picking off bond. Let the soaking do most of the work.

Third, never try to clean lashes while they are on your eyes. This can cause eye irritation or infection. Always remove them first. This ensures you can clean them thoroughly. It also prevents any cleaning solution from entering your eyes.

Fourth, do not store wet lashes. As mentioned, wet lashes can grow mold. This is unhygienic and can ruin the lashes. Ensure they are completely air dried before putting them away. Making these simple adjustments in your cleaning routine will ensure your Lashify lashes last longer and perform better.

### When to Discard Your Lashify Lashes

Even with the best cleaning practices, Lashify Gossamer lashes do not last forever. They are reusable, but they have a lifespan. Knowing when to discard them is important for hygiene and aesthetics. Continuing to use worn-out lashes can affect your eye health and the final look.

First, check the lash band or spine. If it appears bent, broken, or misshapen, it is time to say goodbye. A damaged spine will not adhere correctly to your natural lashes. This can lead to an uncomfortable wear or a crooked application. You want a strong base for proper adhesion.

Second, inspect the lash fibers themselves. If they are sparse, frayed, or losing their curl, the lashes have reached their end. Over time, fibers can shed or become damaged. This happens with repeated cleaning and wear. Lashes that have lost their fluffiness will not give you the desired volume or length. They will look thin and worn.

Finally, consider hygiene. If you have had an eye infection, discard the lashes immediately. No amount of cleaning can guarantee safety after an infection. It is better to be safe than sorry. Also, if you notice any unusual smell or persistent residue you cannot remove, throw them out. A new pair ensures freshness and safety. Knowing when to discard helps you maintain good eye hygiene and a flawless lash look.

### Maintaining Your Lashify System for Longevity

Beyond cleaning the individual Gossamer lashes, maintaining your entire Lashify system contributes to longevity. Proper care of your tools and products makes a big difference. This holistic approach ensures everything works well together. It also keeps your investment protected.

Regularly clean your application tools. The Fuse Control Wand and any other applicators can accumulate bond residue. Use isopropyl alcohol on a cotton pad to wipe them down after each use. Clean tools help you apply lashes more smoothly. They prevent old bond from transferring to new applications.

Store your bonds and sealants correctly. Keep them in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight. High temperatures can affect the formula. This can make the bond less effective or cause it to dry out faster. Always close the caps tightly after each use. Air exposure can also dry out the product.

Check the expiration dates on your Lashify products. Like all cosmetics, bonds and sealants have a shelf life. Using expired products can lead to poor adhesion or eye irritation. Discard any products that appear separated, discolored, or have an unusual smell. Following these steps helps your entire Lashify system perform at its best. It extends the life of your products and tools, making your lash routine easier and more effective.
