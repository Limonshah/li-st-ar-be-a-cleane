## Keeping Your Lashes Flawless: How to Clean Lashify Lashes

Have you invested in the beautiful, natural look of Lashify lashes? Maintaining them is just as important as the application! Cleaning your Lashify lashes regularly extends their lifespan, prevents irritation, and keeps your eyes healthy. This article will guide you through everything you need to know about cleaning your Lashify lashes, ensuring they stay gorgeous and ready for your next application. We’ll cover gentle cleaning methods, proper storage, and troubleshooting common issues.

**Takeaway:**

*   Clean your Lashify lashes after *every* wear.
*   Use a gentle, oil-free cleanser.
*   Store lashes properly to maintain their curl and shape.
*   Regular cleaning prevents bacteria buildup and extends lash life.

**Quick Answer:** To clean Lashify lashes, gently remove any remaining glue with an oil-free makeup remover or lash cleanser. Rinse with water, pat dry, and store them in their original case to maintain their shape and hygiene.

## Why Cleaning Your Lashify Lashes Matters

Cleaning your Lashify lashes isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about health and longevity. After each wear, residue from mascara, eyeliner, and most importantly, the Lashify Bond & Seal, accumulates on the lashes. This buildup can harbor bacteria, leading to eye irritation, infections, and even premature lash shedding. Think of it like this: you wouldn’t reuse a makeup brush without cleaning it, and your lashes deserve the same care! Regular cleaning also ensures the Bond & Seal adheres properly for future applications, giving you the best possible look.

## Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Before you begin, gather everything you’ll need for a thorough cleaning. You don’t need a lot of fancy products – simplicity is key. Here’s a checklist:

*   **Oil-Free Makeup Remover:** This is crucial for dissolving the Lashify Bond & Seal. Avoid oil-based removers, as oil can damage the lash fibers.
*   **Lash Cleanser (Optional):** Specifically formulated lash cleansers are gentle and effective.
*   **Soft Brush:** A clean mascara wand or a small, soft brush works perfectly.
*   **Clean Water:** Distilled or filtered water is ideal.
*   **Lint-Free Cloth or Paper Towel:** For gently patting the lashes dry.
*   **Lash Case:** The original Lashify case is best for storage.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Lashify Lashes

Now, let's get to the cleaning process! Follow these steps for a thorough and gentle clean:

1.  **Remove Excess Glue:** Gently peel off any visible clumps of dried Bond & Seal. Avoid pulling or tugging on the lashes.
2.  **Apply Makeup Remover:** Dip your soft brush into the oil-free makeup remover. Carefully coat the lashes, focusing on the base where the glue is most concentrated.
3.  **Gently Brush:** Use the brush to gently work the makeup remover through the lashes, loosening the glue and debris.
4.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse the lashes under lukewarm water, ensuring all traces of makeup remover and glue are removed.
5.  **Pat Dry:** Gently pat the lashes dry with a lint-free cloth or paper towel. Avoid rubbing, as this can damage the delicate fibers.
6.  **Storage:** Once completely dry, carefully place the lashes back into their original Lashify case. This helps maintain their curl and shape.

## Dealing with Stubborn Glue Residue

Sometimes, the Bond & Seal can be particularly stubborn. If you’re struggling to remove all the glue, try these tips:

*   **Soak:** Let the lashes soak in the oil-free makeup remover for a few minutes before brushing.
*   **Repeat:** Repeat the cleaning process if necessary. Don’t be afraid to go over the lashes multiple times.
*   **Gentle Tweezers:** For particularly stubborn bits, use clean tweezers to *gently* remove the residue. Be extremely careful not to damage the lashes.

## Proper Storage for Long-Lasting Lashes

Cleaning is only half the battle; proper storage is essential for maintaining the quality of your Lashify lashes. Always store your lashes in their original case. This protects them from dust, dirt, and damage. Avoid bending or crushing the lashes, as this can distort their shape. Keep the case in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Proper storage will significantly extend the lifespan of your lashes, allowing you to enjoy them for many applications.

## Cleaning Alternatives & What to Avoid

While the method above is highly recommended, there are a few alternatives. Some people use micellar water, but always ensure it’s oil-free. However, there are certain things you should *always* avoid. Never use harsh chemicals, alcohol-based cleansers, or hot water, as these can damage the lash fibers. Also, avoid rubbing the lashes vigorously, as this can cause them to fall apart. Remember, gentle is key!

## FAQ About Cleaning Lashify Lashes

**Q: How often should I clean my Lashify lashes?**

**Q: Can I use baby shampoo to clean my lashes?**

A: Rinse the lashes again with lukewarm water, ensuring all traces of makeup remover are gone. You may need to repeat the cleaning process.

A: Look for bent, broken, or misshapen lashes. If the fibers are brittle or falling out easily, it’s time to replace them.

**Q: Can I use a lash serum after cleaning?**
A: Yes, a lash serum can help nourish and strengthen your natural lashes, but apply it *before* applying your Lashify lashes, not directly to them.
