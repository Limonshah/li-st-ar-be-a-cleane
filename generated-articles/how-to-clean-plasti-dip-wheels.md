## Keeping Your Ride Rolling: How To Clean Plasti Dip Wheels

Have you customized your wheels with Plasti Dip? It’s a fantastic way to change up your car’s look without a huge investment. But maintaining that fresh, dipped finish requires a little know-how.  This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about how to clean Plasti Dip wheels, keeping them looking sharp for years to come. We’ll cover the best cleaning methods, products to avoid, and preventative measures to protect your investment. Let’s dive in and keep those wheels rolling in style!

**Takeaway:**

*   Use pH-neutral soap and water for regular cleaning.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, and high-pressure washers.
*   Apply a protective sealant to help prevent peeling and fading.
*   Regular cleaning prevents buildup that can damage the Plasti Dip.

**Quick Answer:** To clean Plasti Dip wheels effectively, use a pH-neutral car wash soap, warm water, a soft wash mitt, and a gentle drying towel. Avoid harsh chemicals and high-pressure washing, as these can damage the coating.

## Understanding Plasti Dip & Why Gentle Cleaning Matters

Plasti Dip is a rubber coating that’s incredibly popular for wheel customization. It’s flexible, durable, and relatively easy to apply. However, it's still a coating, and like any coating, it needs proper care. Unlike a traditional paint job, Plasti Dip is more susceptible to damage from harsh chemicals and abrasive cleaning methods.  Using the wrong products can cause peeling, cracking, or fading, ruining your custom look.  Therefore, understanding the material and adopting a gentle cleaning approach is crucial for long-lasting results.

## The Right Tools for the Job: What You’ll Need

Before you start, gather the necessary supplies. Having everything on hand will make the cleaning process much smoother and more efficient. Here’s a checklist of what you’ll need:

*   **pH-Neutral Car Wash Soap:** This is the most important item! Avoid anything acidic or alkaline.
*   **Two Buckets:** One for soapy water, one for rinsing your wash mitt.
*   **Soft Wash Mitt:** Microfiber is ideal, as it won’t scratch the Plasti Dip.
*   **Gentle Drying Towel:** Again, microfiber is your friend.
*   **Wheel Brush (Optional):** For getting into tight spaces, choose a brush with soft bristles.
*   **Hose with a Gentle Spray Nozzle:** Avoid high-pressure settings.
*   **Plasti Dip Sealant (Optional):** For added protection.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Plasti Dip Wheels

Now that you have your supplies, let's get cleaning! Follow these steps for a safe and effective clean:

1.  **Rinse:** Begin by rinsing your wheels with water to remove loose dirt and debris.
2.  **Wash:** Mix your pH-neutral car wash soap with water in one bucket, following the product instructions. Dip your wash mitt into the soapy water and gently wash each wheel, working from top to bottom.
3.  **Rinse Again:** Thoroughly rinse each wheel with clean water, ensuring all soap residue is removed.
4.  **Dry:** Use a clean, soft microfiber towel to dry each wheel completely.  Don't let the water air dry, as this can leave spots.
5.  **Seal (Optional):**  After drying, consider applying a Plasti Dip sealant to help protect the finish from UV rays and road grime.

## What *Not* To Do: Products to Avoid

Knowing what *not* to use is just as important as knowing what *to* use. Certain products can quickly damage your Plasti Dip finish. Here’s a list of things to avoid:

*   **Harsh Chemicals:**  This includes brake cleaners, degreasers, and any cleaners containing solvents.
*   **Abrasive Cleaners:**  Scrubbing powders, steel wool, and even some bug and tar removers can scratch and damage the Plasti Dip.
*   **High-Pressure Washers:** The force of a pressure washer can lift the Plasti Dip from the wheel, causing peeling.
*   **Acidic or Alkaline Cleaners:** These can break down the rubber coating.
*   **Automatic Car Washes:** The harsh brushes and chemicals used in automatic car washes are generally not safe for Plasti Dip.

If you're dealing with stubborn brake dust, consider a dedicated wheel cleaner specifically formulated for delicate finishes.  Always test in an inconspicuous area first!

## Preventing Damage: Long-Term Care for Plasti Dip Wheels

Cleaning is important, but preventative care can significantly extend the life of your Plasti Dip finish. Here are a few tips:

*   **Regular Cleaning:**  Wash your wheels every 1-2 weeks to prevent dirt and grime buildup.
*   **Wax or Sealant:** Apply a quality wax or sealant specifically designed for Plasti Dip every few months. This will provide a protective layer against UV rays, road salt, and other contaminants.
*   **Avoid Curbing:**  Obvious, but worth mentioning! Curbing can easily damage the Plasti Dip.
*   **Inspect Regularly:**  Check your wheels for any signs of peeling or cracking. Address any issues promptly to prevent further damage.
*   **Proper Storage:** If storing wheels with Plasti Dip, keep them out of direct sunlight and extreme temperatures.

## Dealing with Peeling or Damage

Even with the best care, Plasti Dip can sometimes peel or become damaged. If you notice any peeling, address it immediately. Small areas can often be touched up with additional coats of Plasti Dip. For larger areas, you may need to re-dip the entire wheel.  If you're unsure about the repair process, consider consulting a professional detailer.
