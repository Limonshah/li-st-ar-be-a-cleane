## Keeping Cool: How To Clean Thermador Refrigerator Coils

Is your Thermador refrigerator not cooling as efficiently as it used to?  Cleaning your refrigerator coils might be the solution. Dirty coils force your refrigerator to work harder, leading to higher energy bills and a potentially shortened lifespan. This guide will walk you through how to safely and effectively clean the refrigerator coils on your Thermador appliance, ensuring it runs smoothly for years to come. We’ll cover everything from locating the coils to the tools you’ll need and step-by-step instructions.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly cleaning your Thermador refrigerator coils improves efficiency.
*   It lowers energy consumption and extends the life of your appliance.
*   The process is straightforward and can be done with basic tools.

**Quick Answer:** To clean Thermador refrigerator coils, unplug the refrigerator, locate the coils (usually at the back or bottom), vacuum them with a brush attachment, and wipe down any remaining dust with a damp cloth. Remember to power the refrigerator back on after ensuring everything is dry.

## Why Cleaning Thermador Refrigerator Coils Matters

Your refrigerator’s coils are responsible for releasing heat. When these coils are covered in dust, pet hair, and debris, they can’t efficiently dissipate heat. This causes the refrigerator to overwork itself to maintain the set temperature.  Think of it like trying to breathe through a clogged nose – it takes more effort!  Cleaning these coils regularly can significantly improve your refrigerator’s performance.  A clean system means lower energy bills and a longer-lasting appliance.

## Locating the Refrigerator Coils on Your Thermador

The location of the refrigerator coils varies depending on the Thermador model.  Generally, you’ll find them in one of two places: on the back of the refrigerator or underneath it.  If your Thermador is a newer model, the coils are likely hidden behind a panel at the bottom front.  

*   **Rear-Mounted Coils:** These are exposed and easily accessible. You’ll see a grid-like structure on the back of the refrigerator.
*   **Bottom-Mounted Coils:**  You’ll need to locate the access panel, usually at the bottom front.  You may need a screwdriver to remove the panel.  Refer to your Thermador refrigerator’s user manual for specific instructions on locating and accessing the coils.  If you've lost your manual, many are available online through the Thermador website.

## Tools You’ll Need for the Job

Gathering the right tools before you start makes the cleaning process much easier. You won’t need anything fancy! Here’s a list of what you’ll need:

*   **Vacuum Cleaner:**  A vacuum with a brush attachment is essential for removing loose dust and debris.
*   **Soft Brush:** A long-handled, soft-bristled brush can help loosen stubborn dust.
*   **Screwdriver:**  Needed to remove the access panel if your coils are located underneath the refrigerator.
*   **Microfiber Cloth:** For wiping down the coils after vacuuming.
*   **Warm Water:**  Slightly dampening the cloth helps pick up remaining dust.
*   **Gloves (Optional):** To protect your hands.



## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Thermador Refrigerator Coils

Now that you’ve located the coils and gathered your tools, let’s get cleaning!  Follow these steps for best results.

1.  **Safety First: Unplug the Refrigerator.** This is crucial to prevent electrical shock.
2.  **Access the Coils:** Remove the access panel (if applicable) or ensure clear access to the coils on the back of the refrigerator.
3.  **Vacuum the Coils:** Using the brush attachment on your vacuum, gently vacuum the coils. Work from top to bottom, being careful not to bend or damage the coils.  Pay attention to corners and crevices where dust accumulates.
4.  **Brush Away Stubborn Dust:** If vacuuming doesn’t remove all the dust, use the soft brush to gently loosen it. Then, vacuum again.
5.  **Wipe Down with a Damp Cloth:** Lightly dampen a microfiber cloth with warm water and wipe down the coils to remove any remaining dust.  Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners.
6.  **Dry Thoroughly:** Ensure the coils are completely dry before restoring power to the refrigerator.
7.  **Reassemble and Plug In:** Replace the access panel (if removed) and plug the refrigerator back in.

## Dealing with Difficult-to-Reach Coils

Sometimes, the coils are in a particularly tight or awkward space.  If you’re having trouble reaching them, consider these tips:

*   **Use a Crevice Tool:** A narrow crevice tool attachment for your vacuum can help reach into tight spaces.
*   **Extendable Brush:** An extendable brush allows you to reach further without straining.
*   **Mirror:** A small mirror can help you see the coils in hard-to-view areas.
*   **Professional Help:** If you’re uncomfortable cleaning the coils yourself, or if they are extremely difficult to access, consider hiring a professional appliance repair technician.  They have the tools and expertise to safely and effectively clean your Thermador refrigerator coils.



## How Often Should You Clean Your Thermador Refrigerator Coils?

The frequency of cleaning depends on factors like pet ownership, dust levels in your home, and how often you use your refrigerator. However, a good rule of thumb is to clean the coils **at least twice a year**. If you have pets that shed a lot, or if you live in a dusty environment, you may need to clean them more frequently – perhaps every three to four months.  Regular maintenance like this can prevent bigger problems down the road.
