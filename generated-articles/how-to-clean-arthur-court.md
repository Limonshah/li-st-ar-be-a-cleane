## Understanding Arthur Court Aluminum

Arthur Court is renowned for its beautifully detailed aluminum tableware. It’s not silver, despite its appearance, and this is a crucial distinction when it comes to cleaning. Aluminum is a relatively soft metal, making it susceptible to scratches if treated harshly. Understanding this will help you choose the right cleaning methods and avoid damaging your treasured pieces.  Unlike some metals, aluminum doesn’t rust, but it *can* tarnish, developing a dull, grayish film over time.  Knowing this helps you understand why regular cleaning and polishing are important.

## Is Arthur Court Dishwasher Safe?

While some Arthur Court pieces are labeled dishwasher safe, handwashing is *always* the recommended method. The high heat and harsh detergents in dishwashers can dull the finish and potentially cause discoloration over time.  If you choose to use a dishwasher, use a gentle cycle and a mild detergent. However, to truly preserve the intricate details and shine, handwashing is the best approach.

## Gentle Cleaning: Daily and Regular Care

For everyday cleaning, a simple approach is best. After each use, wash your Arthur Court pieces with warm water and a mild dish soap. Use a soft sponge or cloth – avoid abrasive scrubbers like steel wool, which will scratch the surface. Rinse thoroughly to remove all soap residue, as leftover soap can contribute to spotting and dullness.  Immediately dry each piece with a soft, clean towel.  This prevents water spots and helps maintain the shine.

### Removing Food Stains

Sometimes, food residue can be a bit more stubborn. For stuck-on food, soak the item in warm, soapy water for a short period – no more than 30 minutes. Then, gently scrub with a soft sponge.  You can also try a paste made of baking soda and water for tougher stains. Apply the paste gently, let it sit for a few minutes, and then rinse thoroughly.  Remember, patience and gentle pressure are key!

## Polishing Arthur Court for a Brilliant Shine

Over time, even with careful cleaning, Arthur Court pieces can develop a dullness or tarnish. Polishing restores the original shine and protects the aluminum. Use a polish specifically designed for aluminum – avoid silver polish, as it can damage the finish. Apply a small amount of polish to a soft cloth and gently rub it onto the surface, following the grain of the metal.  

### Choosing the Right Polish

There are many aluminum polishes available, so choose one that suits your needs. Some polishes are liquid, while others are creams or pastes.  Always follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.  After polishing, buff the piece with a clean, soft cloth to remove any remaining polish residue.  This will leave your Arthur Court pieces looking beautifully polished and renewed.

## Preventing Tarnish and Maintaining Your Collection

Preventing tarnish is easier than removing it! Proper storage is crucial. When not in use, store your Arthur Court pieces in a dry place, ideally wrapped in tarnish-resistant cloth or plastic bags. This protects them from exposure to air and moisture, which contribute to tarnishing.  Avoid storing them with other metals, as contact can accelerate the tarnishing process.  Regular, gentle cleaning and occasional polishing will also help prevent tarnish from forming.

## Dealing with Stubborn Tarnishing

If your Arthur Court pieces are heavily tarnished, you may need a more intensive cleaning approach.  A commercial aluminum cleaner designed for removing tarnish can be effective.  Follow the product instructions carefully, and always test the cleaner on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn't damage the finish.  For particularly stubborn tarnish, you might consider a professional cleaning service.  They have the expertise and tools to restore your pieces to their original glory.
