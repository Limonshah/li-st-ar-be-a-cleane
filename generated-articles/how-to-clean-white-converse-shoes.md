## Keep Your Kicks Fresh: How To Clean White Converse Shoes

White Converse shoes are a true style staple. They are timeless, versatile, and complete almost any outfit. However, their bright white canvas presents a challenge: they attract dirt like a magnet. Keeping them looking crisp and new can feel like a constant battle. Many owners struggle to maintain their pristine appearance after just a few wears. This guide offers practical, easy-to-follow steps for how to clean white Converse shoes, ensuring they stay brilliant for a long time.

I remember the first time my favorite pair of white Chuck Taylors got completely covered in mud. I thought they were ruined forever. Over the years, I have learned many effective ways to bring them back to life. This article will share those methods. We will cover everything from simple spot cleaning to more intensive washing techniques. You will also find tips for keeping your white Converse looking fresh after cleaning. Let's make your favorite sneakers sparkle again!

### Takeaway

*   Pre-treat tough stains immediately to prevent setting.
*   Use mild cleaning solutions for canvas and rubber.
*   Hand wash for best results, or machine wash with caution.
*   Always air dry your Converse shoes completely.
*   Apply protective sprays to repel dirt and stains.

To clean white Converse shoes, first remove laces and loose dirt. Spot clean with a mild soap and water solution, or use a baking soda paste for tougher marks. For a deeper clean, machine wash on a delicate cycle inside a mesh bag. Air dry shoes away from direct sunlight or heat to avoid yellowing.

### Getting Started: Prepare Your White Converse for Cleaning

Starting with proper preparation makes cleaning white Converse shoes much easier. It protects the shoe parts and ensures a more thorough clean. You need a few common household items before you begin. Gathering everything beforehand saves time and effort during the cleaning process. This initial phase removes superficial dirt, which helps your cleaning solutions work more effectively on deeper stains.

Taking the time for this step prevents dirt from spreading. It also allows you to assess the shoe's condition. You can then choose the best cleaning method for your specific needs. Skipping preparation can push dirt further into the canvas. This makes it harder to achieve that bright, clean look. I always begin with this crucial step.

#### Gathering Your Cleaning Arsenal

You likely have most of the necessary tools already at home. These items are common household products. They are also gentle enough for delicate canvas materials. Having them ready simplifies the entire cleaning process.

Here is a list of what you will need:

*   **Mild liquid detergent or dish soap:** Choose a gentle formula.
*   **Baking soda:** A natural abrasive and deodorizer.
*   **White vinegar:** Helps break down dirt and odors.
*   **Soft-bristled brush:** An old toothbrush works well for scrubbing.
*   **Microfiber cloths or old towels:** For wiping and drying.
*   **Small bowls:** For mixing cleaning solutions.
*   **Mesh laundry bag:** If you plan to machine wash.
*   **Old newspaper or paper towels:** For stuffing during drying.
*   **Optional: Hydrogen peroxide:** For stubborn yellowing or tough stains.

These basic supplies form your cleaning kit. They are effective and safe for your white Converse. Using the right tools prevents damage to the shoe's material.

#### Initial Steps: Removing Loose Dirt

Before applying any liquids, it is vital to remove all loose dirt. This prevents dirt from turning into mud once wet. It also gives you a clearer view of the actual stains. This step ensures that cleaning solutions only target embedded grime.

Follow these simple steps to remove loose dirt:

1.  **Remove the laces:** Take out the shoelaces completely. Set them aside for separate cleaning.
2.  **Knock off excess dirt:** Gently tap the shoes together over a trash can or outdoors. This dislodges larger chunks of dirt.
3.  **Brush off dried mud:** Use a soft-bristled brush or old toothbrush. Carefully brush away any dried mud or debris from the canvas and rubber soles. Pay attention to crevices. For heavy mud, consider learning [how to clean mud off white shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mud-off-white-shoes) more thoroughly.
4.  **Wipe with a dry cloth:** Use a dry microfiber cloth to wipe down the entire shoe surface. This removes dust and fine particles.

These preparatory steps lay the groundwork. They make sure the canvas is ready for a deeper clean. Properly prepared shoes yield much better cleaning results. This method applies to [how to clean all white Converse](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-all-white-converse) shoes as well, ensuring all parts get attention.

### Effective Hand Cleaning Methods for Canvas

Hand cleaning is often the best approach for white Converse shoes. It gives you precise control over the cleaning process. This method helps target specific stains without damaging the canvas. It is also generally gentler than machine washing. You can adjust the intensity based on the stain's severity.

I find hand cleaning particularly satisfying. It allows me to see the dirt disappear right before my eyes. This section covers various hand cleaning solutions. Choose the one that best suits your needs and the type of stain.

#### Soap and Water Solution

A simple soap and water solution is often enough for everyday dirt and light stains. It is gentle, safe, and effective. This method works well for general grime build-up. It cleans the canvas without harsh chemicals.

Follow these steps for a soap and water clean:

1.  **Mix the solution:** In a small bowl, combine warm water with a few drops of mild liquid detergent or dish soap. Stir until suds form.
2.  **Dampen the brush:** Dip your soft-bristled brush (like an old toothbrush) into the soapy water. Ensure the brush is damp, not soaking wet.
3.  **Scrub the canvas:** Gently scrub the canvas areas of the shoe in small circular motions. Focus on stained areas. Avoid saturating the fabric.
4.  **Wipe clean:** Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth to wipe away the suds and dirt. Rinse the cloth frequently.
5.  **Repeat if necessary:** Continue scrubbing and wiping until the canvas looks clean.
6.  **Clean the laces:** For your laces, mix a small amount of soap and water in a bowl. Place the laces in the solution and gently rub them together. Rinse them thoroughly under running water afterward.

This method is perfect for a quick refresh. It keeps your white Converse looking good between deeper cleans.

#### Baking Soda and Vinegar Power

For more stubborn stains or general yellowing, a paste made from baking soda and white vinegar works wonders. This combination creates a gentle fizzing action. This action helps lift dirt and break down tough grime. Baking soda is a natural abrasive, and vinegar is a mild acid. Together, they form a powerful cleaning duo.

Here is how to use this powerful paste:

1.  **Create the paste:** In a small bowl, mix 1 tablespoon of baking soda with 1/2 tablespoon of white vinegar. Add a small amount of warm water if needed to form a thick paste. The mixture will fizz.
2.  **Apply to stains:** Apply the paste directly onto the stained areas of the canvas. Use your fingers or a brush.
3.  **Scrub gently:** Let the paste sit for 10-15 minutes. Then, gently scrub the stained areas with your soft-bristled brush.
4.  **Rinse thoroughly:** Wipe away the paste with a clean, damp cloth. Make sure all residue is gone. Rinse the cloth often.
5.  **Repeat:** If stains remain, reapply the paste and repeat the process.

This method is highly effective for many types of canvas stains. It also helps with general discoloration.

#### Hydrogen Peroxide for Stubborn Stains

Hydrogen peroxide is an excellent option for really tough stains or persistent yellowing. It acts as a mild bleaching agent without the harshness of chlorine bleach. It can brighten the canvas without damaging the fabric. Always use a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, which is commonly found in drugstores. This method is effective for [how to clean white shoes with hydrogen peroxide](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-white-shoes-with-hydrogen-peroxide) generally.

Use hydrogen peroxide carefully:

1.  **Dilute (optional but recommended):** For general brightening, mix equal parts hydrogen peroxide (3%) and water in a spray bottle. For direct stain removal, use it undiluted.
2.  **Apply directly:** Spray or dab the solution onto the stained areas of the canvas. You can also apply it to yellowed sections.
3.  **Let it sit:** Allow the solution to sit on the shoes for 10-20 minutes. The peroxide needs time to work its magic.
4.  **Scrub and rinse:** Gently scrub with a soft brush. Then, wipe clean with a damp cloth. Ensure no residue remains.
5.  **Sunlight boost (optional):** After treatment, place the shoes in direct sunlight. Sunlight enhances hydrogen peroxide's whitening properties.

Hydrogen peroxide is a reliable choice for restoring brightness. It works especially well on yellowed canvas.

### Tackling the Rubber Elements: Soles and Toe Caps

White Converse are known for their distinctive white rubber soles and toe caps. These parts get dirty just as easily as the canvas. They often show scuff marks, mud, and general grime. Cleaning the rubber effectively makes a huge difference in the shoe's overall appearance. Different cleaning agents work best on rubber than on canvas.

I always pay close attention to these rubber sections. Clean rubber makes the entire shoe look much newer. This section will guide you through cleaning these specific areas.

#### Cleaning White Rubber Soles

The rubber soles of your Converse take a lot of abuse. They pick up dirt, mud, and scuff marks from various surfaces. Fortunately, rubber is non-porous and relatively easy to clean. You can use several common household products for this task.

Here are effective methods for cleaning rubber soles:

*   **Magic Eraser (Melamine Foam):** This is my go-to for rubber. Dampen a Magic Eraser. Gently rub it over the dirty areas of the sole. The abrasive nature of the foam lifts scuff marks and grime easily. It works wonders on rubber.
*   **Baking Soda Paste:** Mix baking soda with a small amount of water to form a thick paste. Apply the paste to the rubber soles. Scrub with an old toothbrush or a stiff brush. Rinse with a damp cloth. This is excellent for general dirt and grime.
*   **Toothpaste (Non-Gel, White):** Apply a small amount of white, non-gel toothpaste to an old toothbrush. Scrub the rubber soles vigorously. The mild abrasives in toothpaste remove scuffs and dirt. Wipe clean with a damp cloth.
*   **Rubbing Alcohol:** For tough marks or residue, dab rubbing alcohol onto a cotton ball or cloth. Rub the affected areas of the sole. Alcohol evaporates quickly and lifts many types of stains. Test in an inconspicuous area first.

Remember to wipe the soles clean with a damp cloth after scrubbing. This removes any residue from the cleaning agent. This is similar to [how to clean white rubber shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-white-rubber-shoes) in general.

#### Restoring the Iconic Toe Caps

The rubber toe caps are a signature feature of Converse shoes. They often get scuffed and dirty quickly. Just like the soles, they need specific attention to look their best. Using the right technique makes them bright white again. Cleaning these caps can completely transform the shoe's front. This process is very similar to general rubber cleaning but focuses on this distinct part.

Use the same methods as for the soles:

*   **Magic Eraser:** This is highly effective for scuff marks on the toe caps. Its gentle abrasive nature removes marks without damaging the rubber.
*   **Baking Soda Paste:** Apply a baking soda and water paste to the toe cap. Scrub with a toothbrush. Let it sit for a few minutes. Then, wipe away the residue.
*   **Toothpaste:** Rub white, non-gel toothpaste onto the toe cap with a brush. Scrub in small circles. Wipe clean with a damp cloth.
*   **Nail Polish Remover (Acetone-Free):** For very stubborn scuffs, dampen a cotton ball with acetone-free nail polish remover. Gently rub the scuff mark. Acetone-free is important to avoid discoloration. Test on a small, hidden spot first. For more detailed instructions on this, refer to specific guides like [how to clean Converse toe caps](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-converse-toe-caps).

Always finish by wiping the toe caps clean with a damp cloth. This removes any cleaning solution residue. A clean toe cap makes a noticeable difference.

### Machine Washing Your White Converse: A Cautious Approach

Machine washing white Converse can save time and effort. However, it requires caution. Improper machine washing can damage the shoes. It can cause them to shrink, lose shape, or even yellow the canvas. I only machine wash my Converse when they are extremely dirty. Hand washing is often preferred for maintaining longevity.

If you choose to machine wash, follow these steps carefully. This method is generally effective for heavily soiled canvas. It requires specific preparation to protect your shoes. This section outlines the safest way to machine wash your beloved sneakers.

#### Prepping for the Washer

Proper preparation is crucial before putting your Converse in the washing machine. This minimizes potential damage and helps achieve a better clean. Skipping these steps can lead to disappointing results. It ensures loose parts do not cause problems during the cycle.

Follow these essential preparation steps:

1.  **Remove laces and insoles:** Always take out the shoelaces and insoles. Wash laces separately in a small mesh bag or by hand. Clean insoles by hand with soap and water, then air dry.
2.  **Remove excess dirt:** Brush off any loose dirt, mud, or debris from the shoes. Use a soft brush or old toothbrush. This prevents dirt from spreading in the washing machine. You might review [how to clean mud off white shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mud-off-white-shoes) for thorough pre-cleaning.
3.  **Pre-treat stains:** Apply a stain remover or a baking soda paste to any prominent stains on the canvas. Let it sit for 15-30 minutes. This helps loosen tough grime before washing.
4.  **Place in a mesh laundry bag:** Put each shoe into a separate mesh laundry bag. Or, place both shoes into one large mesh bag. This protects them from tumbling excessively and hitting the machine's drum. It also prevents laces from getting tangled.

These steps are vital for a successful machine wash. They protect your shoes and your washing machine. For general advice on washing shoes, refer to [how to clean shoes in the washer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-shoes-in-the-washer).

#### The Wash Cycle Settings

Choosing the correct wash cycle and detergent is vital for machine washing Converse. Incorrect settings can cause damage or leave your shoes still dirty. Using a gentle approach is always best. This ensures the canvas and rubber remain intact.

Use these settings for safe machine washing:

*   **Detergent:** Use a small amount of mild liquid laundry detergent. Avoid powdered detergents, as they can leave residue.
*   **Water Temperature:** Use cold water. Hot water can cause the canvas to shrink or the adhesive to weaken. It can also set stains.
*   **Wash Cycle:** Select the "delicate," "gentle," or "hand wash" cycle. This reduces agitation and protects the shoes.
*   **Extra Rinse (Optional):** Consider adding an extra rinse cycle. This ensures all detergent is thoroughly removed.
*   **Avoid Bleach:** Do not use chlorine bleach. It can yellow the rubber and damage the canvas fibers.
*   **Add Towels:** Put a few old towels in the washing machine with your shoes. This provides cushioning. It prevents the shoes from banging against the drum.

Once the cycle is complete, promptly remove the shoes from the washing machine. Proceed immediately to the drying stage. This prevents mildew growth and helps maintain their shape.

### Drying Your Converse: The Crucial Final Step

Proper drying is just as important as the cleaning itself. Incorrect drying methods can undo all your hard work. It can lead to yellowing, shrinkage, or mildew. Always allow your white Converse to air dry completely. This section provides the best practices for drying. It ensures your shoes remain pristine and in good shape.

I have learned the hard way that impatience during drying can ruin a perfect clean. Rushing this step is a common mistake. Take your time to ensure thorough drying.

#### Air Drying is Best

Air drying is the safest and most recommended method for white Converse shoes. It prevents heat damage and maintains the shoe's integrity. It also reduces the risk of yellowing. Direct heat sources can cause the rubber to warp and the canvas to shrink.

Follow these steps for optimal air drying:

1.  **Stuff the shoes:** Gently stuff the inside of each shoe with clean, white paper towels or old newspaper. This absorbs excess moisture. It also helps the shoes retain their shape as they dry. Replace the paper as it becomes damp.
2.  **Find a well-ventilated area:** Place the shoes in a cool, dry place with good air circulation. A sunny spot *outdoors* can help with whitening. However, avoid *direct, intense sunlight* for prolonged periods as it can yellow the rubber.
3.  **Prop them up:** Position the shoes so air can circulate around all sides. You can place them on a shoe rack or hang them from their tongues.
4.  **Allow ample time:** Drying can take 12-24 hours, or even longer, depending on humidity and how wet the shoes became. Do not wear them until they are completely dry inside and out.
5.  **Re-lace when dry:** Once the shoes are fully dry, re-lace them with their cleaned and dried laces.

Patience is key during this stage. Completely dry shoes are less likely to develop odors or mold.

#### Avoiding Yellowing and Shrinkage

Yellowing is a common problem when cleaning white shoes. It happens when residues are not fully rinsed or when shoes are dried improperly. Shrinkage occurs due to excessive heat. Preventing these issues ensures your cleaning efforts are successful.

Here are tips to prevent yellowing and shrinkage:

*   **Rinse thoroughly:** After scrubbing, make sure to rinse all cleaning solution from the canvas and rubber. Any lingering soap residue can oxidize and turn yellow when exposed to air or sunlight. Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe repeatedly until no suds appear.
*   **Avoid harsh chemicals:** Never use chlorine bleach on white Converse. Bleach reacts with the rubber and canvas materials. This reaction often leads to permanent yellowing. Stick to gentler alternatives like hydrogen peroxide for brightening.
*   **No direct heat:** Keep shoes away from direct heat sources. This includes radiators, clothes dryers, and intense direct sunlight. High heat causes the canvas to shrink. It also makes the rubber brittle or yellow.
*   **Stuff with white material:** Always stuff shoes with white paper towels or newspaper that does not have colored ink. Colored ink can transfer onto the wet canvas, leaving unsightly stains.
*   **Even drying:** Ensure air circulates evenly around the shoes. Turn them occasionally during the drying process. This promotes uniform drying and prevents moisture from getting trapped.

By following these drying guidelines, your white Converse will stay bright and maintain their original shape.

### Special Stains and Troubleshooting

Sometimes, general cleaning methods are not enough. Certain stains require a more targeted approach. Mud, grass, and mold are particularly challenging. Knowing how to handle these specific problems saves your shoes from being discarded. This section offers solutions for tough stains. It helps you troubleshoot common issues that arise during shoe care.

I have faced many stubborn stains on my white Converse. Learning these specialized techniques has saved many pairs. These methods are designed to be effective without damaging the shoe.

#### Removing Mud and Grass Stains

Mud and grass stains are common culprits for white shoes. They are also notoriously difficult to remove. Prompt treatment is essential for success. Letting these stains dry and set makes them harder to lift. Mud often contains fine particles that embed deeply. Grass stains come from chlorophyll, which dyes fabric. For more information specific to mud, check [how to clean mud off white shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mud-off-white-shoes). And for grass, see [how to clean grass stains off shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-grass-stains-off-shoes).

Here is how to tackle them:

*   **For Mud:**
    1.  **Let it dry:** Do not try to clean wet mud. Let it dry completely.
    2.  **Scrape off:** Once dry, scrape off as much mud as possible with a dull knife or brush.
    3.  **Vacuum (optional):** Use a small handheld vacuum to remove fine dust.
    4.  **Spot clean:** Apply a paste of baking soda and a few drops of dish soap to the remaining stain. Scrub gently with a soft brush.
    5.  **Rinse:** Wipe clean with a damp cloth. Repeat if necessary.

*   **For Grass Stains:**
    1.  **Alcohol solution:** Mix equal parts rubbing alcohol and water.
    2.  **Dab the stain:** Dab the grass stain with a cloth soaked in the alcohol solution. Do not rub, as this can spread the stain.
    3.  **Pre-treat:** Apply a laundry pre-treater or a paste of baking soda and vinegar directly onto the stain.
    4.  **Let it sit:** Allow it to sit for 15-30 minutes.
    5.  **Scrub and rinse:** Gently scrub with a brush. Rinse thoroughly with a damp cloth.

These methods specifically target the properties of mud and grass.

#### Dealing with Mold and Mildew

Mold and mildew can appear on shoes stored in damp, dark places. They not only look unsightly but also cause a musty odor. If left untreated, mold can damage the shoe's material. Addressing mold promptly is crucial for both hygiene and shoe longevity. This is an important consideration for general shoe care, as discussed in [how to clean mold off shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-off-shoes).

Here is how to effectively remove mold and mildew:

1.  **Brush off loose mold:** Take the shoes outdoors. Use a stiff brush to brush off any visible, dry mold spores. Wear gloves and a mask to avoid inhaling spores.
2.  **Vinegar solution:** Mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Vinegar is a natural fungicide and deodorizer.
3.  **Spray and scrub:** Spray the moldy areas thoroughly with the vinegar solution. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes.
4.  **Scrub away:** Use a stiff brush or old toothbrush to scrub the mold away.
5.  **Wipe clean:** Wipe the area with a clean, damp cloth.
6.  **Sunlight exposure:** Place the shoes in direct sunlight for a few hours. UV rays help kill remaining mold spores and remove odors.
7.  **Air dry completely:** Ensure shoes are thoroughly air-dried in a well-ventilated area before storing them.

Prevent mold by storing shoes in dry, airy places. Do not store damp shoes.

### Maintaining Freshness: Preventing Future Stains

Cleaning white Converse is one part of the battle. Preventing future stains is the other. Regular maintenance and protective measures keep your shoes looking cleaner for longer. This reduces the frequency of deep cleaning. It also extends the life of your shoes. Think of it as proactive care.

I always take these extra steps after cleaning my Converse. It saves a lot of hassle in the long run. These simple habits make a big difference.

#### Protective Sprays and Waxes

Applying a protective barrier to your white Converse helps repel dirt and liquids. These products create an invisible shield on the canvas. This makes it harder for stains to penetrate the fabric. It also makes future cleaning much easier. There are various types of protective sprays and waxes available. Choose one specifically designed for fabric or canvas shoes.

Here is how to apply them:

1.  **Ensure shoes are clean and dry:** The shoes must be perfectly clean and completely dry before application. Any trapped dirt will be sealed in.
2.  **Spray evenly:** Hold the spray can about 6-8 inches away from the shoe. Apply a light, even coat over the entire canvas and rubber sections.
3.  **Allow to dry:** Let the first coat dry completely. This usually takes 15-30 minutes, depending on the product.
4.  **Apply second coat:** For better protection, apply a second light coat.
5.  **Cure time:** Allow the shoes to cure for several hours, or even overnight. This lets the protective barrier fully bond with the fabric.
6.  **Reapply as needed:** Protective sprays wear off over time. Reapply every few weeks or months, especially after cleaning or exposure to wet conditions.

These sprays do not make your shoes invincible. They do provide an excellent first line of defense against most common spills and dirt.

#### Regular Light Cleaning

Even with protective sprays, white Converse will still get dirty. Regular, light cleaning prevents dirt from building up and setting into deep stains. This approach maintains a consistent level of cleanliness. It makes deep cleaning less necessary. Think of it as daily upkeep for your shoes.

Incorporate these habits into your routine:

*   **Wipe after each wear:** After wearing your shoes, quickly wipe down the canvas and rubber with a dry or slightly damp cloth. This removes fresh dirt before it can bond with the material.
*   **Spot clean immediately:** If you notice a fresh stain, address it immediately. Use a small amount of mild soap and water on a cloth or an old toothbrush. Prompt action is the most effective way to remove stains. This is similar to [how to clean scuff marks off shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-scuff-marks-off-shoes) as soon as they appear.
*   **Clean laces regularly:** Laces often get dirty faster than the shoes. Remove them and hand wash them with soap and water periodically. This keeps the whole shoe looking neat.
*   **Clean insoles for freshness:** Periodically remove and clean the insoles. This helps with odor control and general hygiene. For a deeper dive, check [how to clean the inside of shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-the-inside-of-shoes).
*   **Store properly:** Store your white Converse in a cool, dry place. Avoid leaving them in direct sunlight or damp areas. This prevents discoloration and mold growth.

Consistent light cleaning keeps your white Converse looking fresh and extends their life. It is easier to clean small amounts of dirt than large, set-in stains.

### FAQ Section

#### Can I use bleach on white Converse?

Using chlorine bleach on white Converse is not recommended. Bleach can react with the rubber components, leading to permanent yellowing that is very difficult to remove. It can also weaken the canvas fabric over time. Instead, opt for gentler brightening agents like hydrogen peroxide or a baking soda and vinegar paste for better and safer results.

#### How often should I clean my white Converse?

The cleaning frequency depends on how often you wear your white Converse and where you wear them. For daily wear, a quick wipe-down after each use is good. Deep cleaning, either by hand or machine, might be necessary every few weeks or once a month, or whenever they appear significantly dirty. Regular spot cleaning reduces the need for frequent deep cleans.

#### Why do my white Converse turn yellow after cleaning?

White Converse can turn yellow after cleaning due to several reasons. Common causes include not rinsing soap residue thoroughly from the canvas, using chlorine bleach, or drying them in intense direct sunlight or with direct heat sources like a dryer. Residual soap or bleach can oxidize and cause yellowing. Always rinse well and air dry in a cool, well-ventilated area.

#### Can I put my laces in the washing machine?

Yes, you can machine wash your Converse laces. Place them in a small mesh laundry bag to prevent them from getting tangled or lost in the machine. Wash them on a delicate cycle with your shoes or with a light laundry load. For best results, I often hand wash my laces with soap and water, as it is quick and gentle.

#### What if my white Converse have mold?

If your white Converse have mold, address it immediately. First, brush off loose mold outdoors. Then, spray the affected areas with a solution of equal parts white vinegar and water. Let it sit, then scrub with a brush. Wipe clean, and then air dry the shoes completely in a well-ventilated area, preferably with some sunlight exposure, to kill residual spores.

### Conclusion

Keeping your white Converse shoes looking new does not have to be a daunting task. We have covered various effective methods, from simple spot cleaning with
