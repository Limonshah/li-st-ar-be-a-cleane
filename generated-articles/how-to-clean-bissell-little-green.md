## Keeping Your Floors Fresh: How to Clean a Bissell Little Green

Is your Bissell Little Green losing suction or not cleaning as effectively as it used to? Regular cleaning of the machine itself is just as important as cleaning your carpets and upholstery. A clean machine ensures optimal performance and extends its lifespan. This article will guide you through a comprehensive cleaning process for your Bissell Little Green, covering everything from the tanks to the spray nozzle. We’ll show you how to maintain your portable carpet cleaner so it continues to tackle messes for years to come.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly empty and rinse both the clean and dirty water tanks.
*   Clean the brush roll and nozzle to remove hair and debris.
*   Descale the machine periodically to prevent mineral buildup.
*   Proper storage prevents mold and mildew growth.

**Quick Answer:** To clean your Bissell Little Green, empty and rinse both tanks, clean the brush roll and nozzle, and descale the machine with a vinegar solution. Regular maintenance ensures optimal performance and longevity.

## 1. Emptying and Cleaning the Tanks – The First Step

The clean and dirty water tanks are the workhorses of your Bissell Little Green. Emptying and cleaning these after *every* use is crucial. Leaving dirty water sitting in the tanks can lead to unpleasant odors and bacterial growth. Start by removing both tanks from the unit.  Then, pour out any remaining water. Rinse both tanks thoroughly with warm water, ensuring you remove all traces of cleaning solution and debris. 

For a deeper clean, you can use a mild dish soap. Add a small amount to the tanks with warm water, swish it around, and then rinse completely.  If you notice stubborn stains or buildup in the dirty water tank, consider using a bottle brush to scrub it clean.  You can find more detailed instructions on cleaning the dirty tank specifically [here](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-the-dirty-tank-on-bissell-little-green).  Allow the tanks to air dry completely before reattaching them to the machine.

## 2. Cleaning the Brush Roll and Nozzle – Removing Hidden Debris

Hair, fibers, and other debris can easily wrap around the brush roll and clog the nozzle of your Bissell Little Green. This reduces the machine’s cleaning effectiveness. Begin by unplugging the machine for safety.  Then, remove the brush roll according to your model’s instructions (refer to your owner’s manual).  

Use scissors or a seam ripper to carefully cut away any wrapped hair or fibers from the brush roll.  Next, inspect the nozzle for any blockages. You can use a small brush or a toothpick to dislodge any trapped debris.  For a more thorough cleaning of the nozzle, check out this guide on [how to clean the Green Machine head](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-green-machine-head).  Reassemble the brush roll and nozzle once they are clean and dry.

## 3. Descaling Your Bissell Little Green – Fighting Mineral Buildup

Over time, mineral deposits from tap water can build up inside your Bissell Little Green, affecting its performance. Descaling removes these deposits and keeps the machine running smoothly. A simple solution of equal parts white vinegar and water works wonders. 

Pour the vinegar solution into the clean water tank. Run the machine with the solution, but *do not* spray it onto any surfaces. Allow it to run for about 5-10 minutes. Then, empty the tank and rinse it thoroughly with clean water. Repeat this process with fresh water several times to ensure all traces of vinegar are removed.  This prevents any lingering vinegar smell during future cleaning sessions.

## 4. Cleaning the Hose – Addressing Hidden Mold and Mildew

The hose of your Bissell Little Green can harbor hidden mold and mildew, especially if the machine isn’t dried properly after use. To clean the hose, detach it from the unit.  Fill a sink or bucket with warm water and a mild detergent. Submerge the hose and gently swish it around to loosen any buildup. 

You can also use a long brush or pipe cleaner to scrub the inside of the hose. Rinse the hose thoroughly with clean water until all traces of detergent are gone.  Before reattaching, ensure the hose is completely dry to prevent mold growth.

## 5. Exterior Cleaning – Keeping It Looking New

Don't forget to clean the exterior of your Bissell Little Green! Wipe down the machine’s casing with a damp cloth and a mild cleaning solution. Avoid using abrasive cleaners, as they can scratch the plastic. Pay attention to areas where dirt and grime tend to accumulate, such as around the buttons and handles.  

For stubborn stains, you can use a magic eraser, but test it in an inconspicuous area first.  Ensure the machine is unplugged and completely dry before cleaning the exterior. A clean exterior not only looks better but also helps prevent the spread of germs.

## 6. Proper Storage – Preventing Future Issues

Proper storage is key to maintaining your Bissell Little Green and preventing future cleaning headaches. After each use, always empty both tanks and allow them to air dry completely.  Leave the cap off the clean water tank to allow for ventilation. 

Store the machine in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight. Avoid storing it in damp areas, as this can promote mold and mildew growth.  If you live in a humid climate, consider storing the machine with a desiccant packet to absorb any excess moisture.  Proper storage will ensure your Bissell Little Green is ready to tackle your next mess.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues – When Cleaning Isn’t Enough

Sometimes, even with regular cleaning, your Bissell Little Green might experience issues. If you notice a loss of suction, check for clogs in the hose, nozzle, or brush roll. If the machine isn’t picking up water, there might be a blockage in the dirty water tank or a problem with the pump.
