## Keeping Your Floors Fresh: How to Clean a Bissell Revolution Pet Pro

Is your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro losing suction or leaving behind a trail of pet hair? Don't worry, a thorough cleaning can often restore it to its former glory. This guide will walk you through every step of cleaning your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro, from the brush roll to the tanks, ensuring it continues to tackle pet messes effectively. We’ll cover everything you need to know to maintain peak performance and extend the life of your machine. Let's dive in and get your Bissell sparkling clean!

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly empty and clean the dirty water tank.
*   Remove and wash the brush roll to eliminate hair tangles.
*   Clean or replace filters to maintain suction power.
*   Wipe down the exterior and attachments for hygiene.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro, empty and clean the dirty water tank, remove and wash the brush roll, clean or replace the filters, and wipe down the exterior. Regular maintenance ensures optimal performance and extends the life of your machine.

## 1. Emptying and Cleaning the Dirty Water Tank

The dirty water tank is where all the grime and pet messes end up, so it needs regular attention.  Emptying it after *every* use is crucial to prevent odors and maintain hygiene. Start by removing the tank from the base of the machine – it usually just lifts right out.  Then, pour the dirty water into a sink or toilet, being careful to avoid splashing. 

Next, disassemble the tank components – the cap, filter, and float. Wash these parts with warm, soapy water, ensuring you remove all traces of dirt and debris.  A small brush can be helpful for getting into tight spaces.  Rinse thoroughly and allow everything to air dry completely before reassembling.  For a deeper clean, you can use a mild vinegar solution to disinfect the tank.

## 2. Removing and Cleaning the Brush Roll

The brush roll is the workhorse of your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro, responsible for agitating carpets and loosening dirt.  Pet hair and fibers quickly wrap around it, reducing its effectiveness. To access the brush roll, locate the access door on the bottom of the machine. Open the door and carefully remove the brush roll. 

Now, this is where things can get a little messy! Use scissors or a seam ripper to carefully cut away any tangled hair, string, or fibers. Be careful not to damage the bristles. Once the brush roll is free of debris, wash it with warm, soapy water. Rinse thoroughly and allow it to air dry completely before reinstalling.  Regularly cleaning the brush roll will significantly improve your vacuum’s cleaning performance.

## 3. Cleaning or Replacing the Filters

Filters are essential for trapping dust and allergens, but they become clogged over time, reducing suction power. Your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro likely has multiple filters – a pre-filter and a post-filter. Check your owner’s manual for the specific location of each filter.

Remove the filters and rinse them under cool water. Gently tap them to remove excess water, but *do not* use soap. Allow the filters to air dry completely – this is crucial, as using damp filters can damage the machine.  Filters should be replaced every 3-6 months, depending on usage.  Replacing filters ensures optimal suction and air quality.  You can find replacement filters on the Bissell website or at most retailers.

## 4. Cleaning the Exterior and Attachments

The exterior of your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro can accumulate dust and grime, so it’s important to wipe it down regularly. Use a damp cloth with a mild cleaning solution to clean the body of the machine. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the plastic.

Don't forget to clean the attachments, such as the pet turbo brush or crevice tool. Remove them from the machine and wash them with warm, soapy water. Rinse thoroughly and allow them to air dry.  Keeping the exterior and attachments clean not only improves hygiene but also makes your machine look newer for longer.

## 5. Addressing Suction Issues and Troubleshooting

If your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro is still experiencing suction issues after cleaning, there are a few things you can check. First, ensure that the dirty water tank is properly seated and not overflowing.  Next, check for any blockages in the hose or wand.  You can use a long, flexible brush to dislodge any obstructions. 

Also, verify that the filters are clean and dry. A clogged filter is a common cause of suction loss. If you've tried all of these steps and the suction is still weak, it may be time to contact Bissell customer support.  Sometimes, a more serious issue may require professional repair.

## 6. Maintaining Your Bissell: Preventative Measures

Preventative maintenance can significantly extend the life of your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro and keep it running smoothly.  Empty the dirty water tank after *every* use.  Clean the brush roll at least once a month, or more frequently if you have pets that shed a lot.  Rinse or replace the filters every 3-6 months. 

Regularly inspect the hose and attachments for any signs of damage or wear.  Store your Bissell in a clean, dry place when not in use.  By following these simple preventative measures, you can avoid costly repairs and enjoy years of reliable cleaning performance.

## 7. Deep Cleaning the Solution Tank (If Applicable)

Some Bissell Revolution Pet Pro models have a separate solution tank for clean water and cleaning solution. If yours does, it's important to clean this tank periodically to prevent buildup and maintain optimal performance.  Remove the tank and empty any remaining solution. 

Rinse the tank with warm water, and then fill it with a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar. Let it sit for 30 minutes, then scrub the inside of the tank with a soft brush. Rinse thoroughly with clean water and allow it to air dry completely before refilling.  This deep cleaning will help prevent clogs and ensure that your Bissell is delivering the right amount of cleaning solution.
