This article will guide you through a simple, step-by-step process to clean your Bissell Featherweight filter, ensuring your floors stay spotless. We’ll cover everything from identifying the filter to drying it properly, so you can get back to cleaning in no time. Let's dive in and restore your vacuum’s power!

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly cleaning your Bissell Featherweight filter maintains suction power.
*   A clean filter improves air quality by trapping dust and allergens.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean your Bissell Featherweight filter, remove it from the vacuum, gently tap off loose debris, rinse it with cool water until clear, and allow it to air dry completely (24-48 hours) before reinstalling.



## Understanding Your Bissell Featherweight Filter

The Bissell Featherweight utilizes a washable filter, which is a fantastic feature for saving money and reducing waste. This filter is designed to trap dust, dirt, and allergens, preventing them from being recirculated into your home’s air. Knowing what your filter looks like and where it’s located is the first step to keeping it clean.  The filter is typically found inside the dust bin compartment.  Regularly checking and cleaning this filter will significantly improve your vacuum’s performance.

## Removing the Filter for Cleaning

Before you can clean the filter, you need to remove it from the Bissell Featherweight.  This process is straightforward and shouldn’t take more than a minute. First, unplug your vacuum from the power outlet for safety. Next, locate the dust bin and detach it from the main body of the vacuum.  The filter is usually easily accessible within the dust bin. Gently remove the filter, being careful not to damage it.  If you're unsure, consult your Bissell Featherweight owner’s manual for specific instructions.  

## The Cleaning Process: Rinsing and Removing Debris

Now that you have the filter removed, it’s time to clean it. Start by gently tapping the filter against a trash can to remove any loose dust and debris.  This prevents clogging your sink drain during rinsing. Next, rinse the filter under cool running water. Avoid using hot water, as it could damage the filter material. Gently massage the filter to loosen any embedded dirt. Continue rinsing until the water runs clear, indicating that all the debris has been removed.  For a deeper clean, you can use a mild detergent, but ensure it's thoroughly rinsed away.

## Drying the Filter Completely

This is arguably the most important step! A damp filter can lead to mold and mildew growth, which can damage your vacuum and release unpleasant odors.  Never reinstall a filter that isn’t completely dry.  Allow the filter to air dry for at least 24-48 hours. Place it in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight or heat.  Avoid using a hairdryer or other heat source to speed up the drying process, as this could warp or damage the filter.  Ensure the filter is *completely* dry to the touch before proceeding.  

## How Often Should You Clean Your Filter?

The frequency of filter cleaning depends on how often you use your Bissell Featherweight and the type of surfaces you’re cleaning. As a general guideline, clean the filter every 1-3 months with regular use. If you have pets or allergies, you may need to clean it more frequently – perhaps every month or even more often.  Pay attention to your vacuum’s performance; if you notice a decrease in suction, it’s a good indication that the filter needs cleaning.  Regular maintenance like this can prevent the need for more extensive repairs.  Speaking of maintenance, did you know you can also easily clean the tank on your Bissell Little Green?

## Replacing Your Filter When Necessary

While the Bissell Featherweight filter is washable, it won’t last forever. Over time, the filter material can become worn and less effective at trapping dust and allergens. If you notice that the filter is damaged, torn, or no longer effectively cleaning even after washing, it’s time to replace it.  Check your Bissell Featherweight owner’s manual for the correct replacement filter model number. Replacing the filter ensures your vacuum continues to perform at its best and protects your home’s air quality.
