## Keeping Your Rug Doctor Sparkling: A Complete Cleaning Guide

Is your Rug Doctor looking a little worse for wear after tackling tough stains? Maintaining your Rug Doctor is crucial for ensuring it continues to deliver powerful cleaning performance. A clean machine means cleaner carpets and a longer lifespan for your investment. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about how to clean a Rug Doctor, from the tanks to the brushes, ensuring it’s ready for your next deep cleaning session. Let’s get started!

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly empty and rinse both the clean and dirty water tanks.
*   Clean the spray jets and nozzles to prevent clogging.
*   Remove and clean the brush roll to eliminate hair and debris.
*   Use a Rug Doctor cleaning solution specifically designed for machine maintenance.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean a Rug Doctor, empty and rinse both tanks, clean the spray jets, remove and clean the brush roll, and run a cleaning cycle with a Rug Doctor cleaning solution. Regular maintenance extends the life of your machine and ensures optimal cleaning performance.

## 1. Why Cleaning Your Rug Doctor Matters

You wouldn’t cook with a dirty oven, would you? The same principle applies to your Rug Doctor. Over time, dirt, grime, and cleaning solution residue can build up inside the machine, impacting its performance and potentially causing damage. A buildup of debris can clog spray jets, reduce suction power, and even lead to unpleasant odors. Regularly cleaning your Rug Doctor ensures it operates efficiently, delivers the best possible cleaning results, and avoids costly repairs down the line. Plus, a well-maintained machine will last longer, saving you money in the long run.

## 2. Cleaning the Rug Doctor Tanks: A Step-by-Step Guide

The tanks are the heart of your Rug Doctor, so keeping them clean is paramount. After each use, it’s essential to empty and rinse both the clean and dirty water tanks. Start by removing both tanks from the machine. Then, empty any remaining water. Rinse each tank thoroughly with warm water, ensuring you remove all traces of cleaning solution and debris. For stubborn residue, you can use a mild dish soap, but be sure to rinse thoroughly afterward.  If you're looking for ways to keep your rugs looking fresh, consider how to clean an outside rug to prevent dirt from being tracked inside.

## 3. Clearing Clogged Spray Jets and Nozzles

Clogged spray jets and nozzles can significantly reduce your Rug Doctor’s cleaning power. These small openings are prone to blockage from mineral deposits and dried cleaning solution. To clear them, remove the spray jets and nozzles (refer to your Rug Doctor’s manual for specific instructions). Soak them in warm water with a small amount of white vinegar for about 30 minutes. This will help dissolve any buildup. Use a small brush or pin to gently clear any remaining debris.  Ensure the jets are fully clear before reattaching them to the machine.

## 4. Maintaining the Brush Roll: Removing Hair and Debris

The brush roll is responsible for agitating and lifting dirt from your carpets. It’s also a magnet for hair, fibers, and other debris. Regularly removing and cleaning the brush roll is vital for maintaining its effectiveness. First, unplug your Rug Doctor and remove the brush roll cover. Carefully remove the brush roll itself. Use scissors or a seam ripper to cut away any tangled hair or fibers.  You can also use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to remove loose debris.  For a deeper clean, wash the brush roll with mild soap and water, ensuring it’s completely dry before reinstalling.

## 5. Deep Cleaning with Rug Doctor Cleaning Solution

Beyond regular rinsing, a deep cleaning cycle with a Rug Doctor cleaning solution designed for machine maintenance is recommended every few months. These solutions help remove stubborn residue and sanitize the internal components of the machine. Follow the instructions on the cleaning solution packaging carefully. Typically, you’ll add the solution to the clean water tank and run a full cleaning cycle without any carpet. This will flush out any remaining debris and leave your Rug Doctor fresh and ready to go.

## 6. Exterior Cleaning and Storage Tips

Don’t forget about the exterior of your Rug Doctor! Wipe down the machine’s housing with a damp cloth to remove any dirt or spills. Pay attention to the handle, wheels, and power cord.  Proper storage is also crucial. Store your Rug Doctor in a clean, dry place, away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures.  Before storing for an extended period, ensure the tanks are completely empty and dry to prevent mold and mildew growth.  If you're dealing with a particularly dirty area, you might also want to consider how to clean a rag rug to prepare it for a deep clean.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Rug Doctor Cleaning Issues

Sometimes, even with regular cleaning, you might encounter issues. Here are a few common problems and how to address them:

*   **Low Suction:** Check the tanks for clogs, clean the spray jets, and ensure the brush roll is clean and rotating freely.
*   **Unpleasant Odor:** Run a cleaning cycle with a Rug Doctor cleaning solution and ensure the tanks are thoroughly rinsed and dried.
*   **Clogged Nozzles:** Soak the nozzles in warm water with vinegar and use a small brush to clear any debris.
*   **Machine Won't Turn On:** Check the power cord and ensure it’s securely plugged in. If the problem persists, consult your Rug Doctor’s manual or contact customer support.
