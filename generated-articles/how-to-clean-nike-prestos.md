## Keeping Your Kicks Fresh: How To Clean Nike Prestos

Do your Nike Prestos need a refresh? These iconic sneakers are known for their comfort and style, but they can quickly show dirt and grime. Luckily, cleaning your Nike Prestos doesn’t have to be a daunting task. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to restore your Prestos to their former glory, from gathering supplies to tackling tough stains. We’ll cover cleaning both the upper and the sole, ensuring a thorough clean every time. 

**Takeaway:**

*   Gather your supplies: mild soap, soft brush, microfiber cloth.
*   Remove loose dirt with a dry brush.
*   Gently clean the upper with soapy water.
*   Clean the sole separately with a brush.
*   Air dry completely, avoiding direct heat.

**Quick Answer:** To clean Nike Prestos, mix mild soap with lukewarm water, gently scrub the upper and sole with a soft brush, rinse thoroughly, and air dry. Avoid using harsh chemicals or machine washing to preserve the shoe’s shape and materials.

## 1. Gathering Your Cleaning Arsenal for Nike Prestos

Before you start, having the right tools makes all the difference. You don’t need anything fancy, just a few essentials to effectively clean your Nike Prestos. This will help you avoid damaging the delicate materials.  A little preparation goes a long way in achieving a spotless result.

Here’s what you’ll need:

*   **Mild Soap:** Dish soap or laundry detergent works well. Avoid harsh chemicals.
*   **Soft-Bristled Brush:** An old toothbrush is perfect for detailed cleaning.
*   **Microfiber Cloth:** For wiping and drying.
*   **Lukewarm Water:** Avoid hot water, as it can damage the materials.
*   **Magic Eraser (Optional):** For stubborn marks on the sole.
*   **Shoe Trees or Paper Towels (Optional):** To help maintain the shoe’s shape while drying.

## 2. Prepping Your Prestos: Removing Loose Dirt

The first step in cleaning your Nike Prestos is removing any loose dirt or debris. This prevents you from grinding the dirt into the material during the washing process.  It’s a quick step that significantly improves the overall cleaning outcome. Think of it like sweeping before you mop – it makes everything easier!

Here’s how to do it:

*   Use a dry, soft-bristled brush to gently brush away dirt from the upper and sole.
*   Pay attention to the grooves in the sole, where dirt tends to accumulate.
*   Remove the laces and insoles for separate cleaning. You can wash laces in a laundry bag.
*   If your laces are particularly dirty, consider replacing them.

## 3. Cleaning the Upper: A Gentle Approach

The upper of your Nike Prestos is typically made of a breathable mesh material, which requires a gentle cleaning approach. Harsh scrubbing or strong chemicals can damage the fabric.  Remember, patience is key when cleaning delicate materials. A little care will keep your Prestos looking great for longer.

Here’s how to clean the upper:

*   Mix a small amount of mild soap with lukewarm water.
*   Dip your soft-bristled brush into the soapy water and gently scrub the upper in circular motions.
*   Focus on areas with visible dirt or stains.
*   Avoid soaking the upper in water.
*   For tougher stains, let the soapy water sit for a few minutes before scrubbing. If you're looking for more ways to keep your home clean, check out this guide on [how to clean your home](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-home).

## 4. Tackling the Sole: Getting Rid of Grime

The sole of your Nike Prestos often bears the brunt of wear and tear, accumulating dirt and grime.  Cleaning the sole requires a bit more effort, but it’s essential for restoring the shoe’s appearance. Don’t be afraid to apply a little more pressure when scrubbing the sole, as it’s more durable than the upper.

Here’s how to clean the sole:

*   Use a slightly stiffer brush to scrub the sole with soapy water.
*   Pay attention to the grooves and treads, where dirt gets trapped.
*   For stubborn marks, use a magic eraser.
*   Rinse the sole thoroughly with clean water.

## 5. Drying Your Prestos: Avoiding Damage

Proper drying is crucial to prevent damage to your Nike Prestos.  Avoid direct heat sources like radiators or direct sunlight, as these can warp the shape of the shoes or cause the materials to crack.  Patience is key – allow your Prestos to air dry completely.

Here’s how to dry your Prestos:

*   Stuff the shoes with shoe trees or paper towels to help maintain their shape.
*   Air dry in a well-ventilated area, away from direct heat and sunlight.
*   Allow the shoes to dry completely before wearing them. This can take several hours or even overnight.
*   Avoid using a dryer, as the heat can damage the materials.

## 6. Dealing with Stubborn Stains on Nike Prestos

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, stubborn stains remain.  Don’t despair! There are a few tricks you can try to tackle those persistent marks.  Remember to test any cleaning solution on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t damage the material.

Here are some tips for dealing with stubborn stains:

*   **Oil Stains:** Sprinkle baking soda on the stain and let it sit overnight. Vacuum off the baking soda in the morning.
*   **Mud Stains:** Let the mud dry completely, then brush it off. If a stain remains, use a damp cloth with mild soap.
*   **Scuff Marks:** Use a magic eraser to gently rub away scuff marks on the sole.

## 7. Maintaining Clean Prestos: Preventative Care

Once you’ve cleaned your Nike Prestos, taking preventative measures will help keep them looking their best for longer.  Regular maintenance is much easier than deep cleaning.  A little effort can significantly extend the life of your shoes.

Here are some tips for maintaining clean Prestos:

*   **Protect with a Shoe Protector:** Apply a shoe protector spray to repel water and stains.
*   **Clean Regularly:** Wipe down your Prestos with a damp cloth after each wear.
*   **Store Properly:** Store your Prestos in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.
