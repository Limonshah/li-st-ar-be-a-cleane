## Keeping Your Pool Crystal Clear: How To Clean Your Intellichlor

Is your pool water looking a little cloudy, even after balancing the chemicals? The culprit might be a dirty Intellichlor salt chlorine generator. An Intellichlor, while a fantastic investment for pool sanitation, requires regular cleaning to maintain peak performance. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to effectively clean your Intellichlor, ensuring a safe and enjoyable swimming experience. We’ll cover everything from recognizing when cleaning is needed to the step-by-step process and preventative measures.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning (every 3-6 months) prevents scale buildup.
*   Use a mild acid solution for effective cleaning.
*   Proper maintenance extends the life of your Intellichlor.
*   Always disconnect power before cleaning.

**What is the best way to clean an Intellichlor?**

To clean an Intellichlor, turn off the power, remove the cell, and soak it in a solution of muriatic acid and water (typically a 5:1 ratio). Let it soak for 15-20 minutes, then rinse thoroughly with a hose before reinstalling.

## Why Cleaning Your Intellichlor Matters

Your Intellichlor converts salt into chlorine, sanitizing your pool water. Over time, calcium and other minerals in the water can build up on the cell plates, reducing its efficiency. This scale buildup hinders the chlorine production, leading to cloudy water and the need for more chemicals. A dirty cell also puts extra strain on the unit, potentially shortening its lifespan. Regularly cleaning your Intellichlor isn’t just about water clarity; it’s about protecting your investment and saving money on pool chemicals.

## Recognizing When Your Intellichlor Needs Cleaning

Don't wait for cloudy water to tell you it's time to clean! Several indicators suggest your Intellichlor cell needs attention. One key sign is a consistently high percentage reading on the cell inspection light.  If the light shows 100%, it means the cell is heavily scaled and needs immediate cleaning. Another indicator is a noticeable decrease in chlorine production, even with proper salt levels. You might also observe a buildup of white, chalky deposits on the cell plates themselves.  Finally, if your pool is consistently requiring more chlorine than usual, it’s a strong signal that your Intellichlor isn’t working at its full capacity.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Your Intellichlor Cell

Cleaning your Intellichlor cell is a straightforward process, but safety is paramount. Always disconnect the power to the unit before beginning. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1.  **Turn Off Power:** Completely shut off the power to your Intellichlor at the breaker. This is crucial for your safety.
2.  **Remove the Cell:** Carefully remove the cell from the Intellichlor housing. Refer to your owner’s manual for specific instructions.
3.  **Prepare the Cleaning Solution:** In a plastic bucket (never metal!), mix muriatic acid with water in a 5:1 ratio (5 parts water to 1 part muriatic acid). *Always add acid to water, never water to acid.* This prevents a dangerous reaction.
4.  **Soak the Cell:** Submerge the cell in the acid solution, ensuring all plates are covered. Let it soak for 15-20 minutes. You’ll likely see bubbling as the scale dissolves.
5.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** After soaking, remove the cell and rinse it thoroughly with a garden hose. Ensure all traces of acid are removed.
6.  **Inspect and Repeat (If Necessary):** Inspect the cell plates. If scale remains, repeat the soaking and rinsing process.
7.  **Reinstall the Cell:** Once clean, carefully reinstall the cell into the Intellichlor housing.
8.  **Restore Power:** Turn the power back on to the Intellichlor.

## Safety Precautions When Cleaning Your Intellichlor

Working with muriatic acid requires strict adherence to safety guidelines. Always wear safety glasses and chemical-resistant gloves to protect your eyes and skin. Work in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling fumes.  Never mix muriatic acid with other chemicals, as this can create dangerous gases.  Keep the acid solution away from children and pets. If acid comes into contact with your skin, rinse immediately with plenty of water.  Proper disposal of the used acid solution is also important; check your local regulations for guidance.

## Preventing Scale Buildup on Your Intellichlor

While cleaning removes existing scale, preventative measures can minimize buildup in the first place. Maintaining proper water chemistry is key. Regularly test and adjust your pool’s pH, alkalinity, and calcium hardness levels.  High calcium hardness is a major contributor to scale formation. Consider using a scale inhibitor product, which helps prevent calcium from adhering to the cell plates.  Also, ensure your pool water is properly circulated to distribute chemicals evenly and prevent localized buildup.  Keeping your pool clean overall, including regular brushing and vacuuming, will also reduce the amount of debris that contributes to scaling.

## Extending the Life of Your Intellichlor

Beyond regular cleaning and preventative maintenance, a few additional steps can extend the life of your Intellichlor. Avoid running the unit at excessively high output levels for prolonged periods.  While it might seem tempting to maximize chlorine production, this can accelerate scale buildup.  Consider investing in a quality Intellichlor cover to protect the unit from the elements.  Finally, schedule an annual inspection by a qualified pool technician to identify and address any potential issues before they become major problems.  Proper care will ensure your Intellichlor continues to provide years of reliable service.



## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How often should I clean my Intellichlor cell?**
A: Generally, you should clean your Intellichlor cell every 3-6 months, depending on your water hardness and pool usage. Regularly monitoring the cell inspection light is a good indicator.

**Q: Can I use vinegar to clean my Intellichlor cell?**
A: While vinegar can dissolve some scale, it’s not as effective as muriatic acid and may require a much longer soaking time. Muriatic acid is the recommended cleaning solution.

**Q: Is it normal for my Intellichlor cell to bubble during cleaning?**
A: Yes, bubbling is normal and indicates that the acid is reacting with the scale buildup.

**Q: What if the scale doesn’t come off after soaking in acid?**
A: Repeat the soaking process, potentially increasing the soaking time slightly. If the scale persists, consult a pool professional.

**Q: Can I clean the Intellichlor cell with a pressure washer?**
A: No, using a pressure washer can damage the cell plates. Gentle rinsing with a garden hose is sufficient.

## Conclusion

Cleaning your Intellichlor is a vital part of maintaining a healthy and enjoyable pool. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can effectively remove scale buildup, optimize chlorine production, and extend the life of your unit. Remember to prioritize safety when working with muriatic acid and to implement preventative measures to minimize scaling. A clean Intellichlor means crystal-clear water and more time enjoying your pool! Don't hesitate to consult a pool professional if you have any concerns or encounter persistent issues.  Keeping your pool sparkling clean is easier than you think, and a little preventative maintenance goes a long way.
