## Craftsman Intek Plus 18 HP Engine Won't Crank: A Troubleshooting Guide

Have you been pulling the starter cord on your Craftsman Intek Plus 18 HP engine, only to be met with silence? It’s frustrating when your equipment won’t start, especially when you have work to do. This article will walk you through the most common reasons why your engine won’t crank and provide step-by-step instructions to get it running again. We’ll cover everything from simple fixes like checking the fuel level to more involved troubleshooting of the starter and solenoid.

**Takeaway:**

*   Check the fuel level and ensure the fuel shut-off valve is open.
*   Inspect the spark plug for fouling or damage.
*   Test the battery and charging system.
*   Examine the starter and solenoid for proper function.
*   Verify the safety switches are engaged correctly.

**Quick Answer:** A Craftsman Intek Plus 18 HP engine that won’t crank usually indicates a problem with the power supply (battery), the starting mechanism (starter, solenoid), a safety switch, or a lack of fuel. Systematic troubleshooting is key to identifying the root cause.

## 1. Fuel System Issues: The First Place to Look

Sometimes, the simplest explanation is the correct one. Before diving into complex repairs, always start by checking your fuel supply. An empty gas tank is a common culprit! Ensure you have fresh gasoline in the tank and that the fuel shut-off valve, if equipped, is open. A clogged fuel line or a dirty carburetor can also prevent the engine from starting. If the engine has been sitting for a long time, the fuel may have gone stale. Consider using a fuel stabilizer in the future to prevent this. 

If you suspect a carburetor issue, you might need to clean it. You can find helpful resources on general engine cleaning techniques [here](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-engine-block).

## 2. Battery and Electrical System Checks

A weak or dead battery is a frequent cause of a no-crank situation. If your Craftsman Intek Plus 18 HP engine has an electric start, begin by testing the battery voltage with a multimeter. A fully charged 12-volt battery should read around 12.6 volts. If the voltage is significantly lower, try charging the battery. If it won’t hold a charge, it likely needs to be replaced. 

Beyond the battery, check the battery terminals for corrosion. Clean them with a wire brush if necessary. Also, inspect the battery cables for damage or loose connections. A faulty charging system (alternator/stator) can also lead to a dead battery.

## 3. Understanding the Starter and Solenoid

The starter motor is responsible for turning the engine over, while the solenoid acts as a switch to send power to the starter. If you hear a click when you turn the key, but the engine doesn’t crank, the solenoid is likely engaging, but the starter may be faulty. To test the starter, you can try bypassing the solenoid (with extreme caution – disconnect the battery first!). 

If you don’t hear a click, the solenoid itself might be bad. You can test the solenoid with a multimeter to see if it’s receiving power when the key is turned. A failing solenoid is a common issue, and replacement is often the easiest solution.

## 4. Safety Switch Inspection: A Crucial Step

Craftsman Intek Plus engines are equipped with safety switches to prevent accidental starting. These switches are typically located on the operator presence control (OPC) lever, the blade engagement lever, or the transmission. If any of these switches are faulty or not engaged properly, the engine won’t crank. 

Carefully inspect each safety switch to ensure it’s functioning correctly. You can often test these switches with a multimeter to verify continuity. Make sure the switches are properly adjusted and that the levers are fully engaged.

## 5. Spark Plug Problems and Ignition System

While a bad spark plug usually results in a no-start condition *after* cranking, a severely fouled or damaged spark plug can sometimes prevent the engine from even turning over. Remove the spark plug and inspect it for carbon buildup, oil fouling, or cracks. A clean, properly gapped spark plug is essential for reliable starting. 

If the spark plug looks bad, replace it with a new one. Also, check the spark plug wire and boot for damage. A loose or corroded connection can prevent the spark plug from firing.

## 6. Flywheel Key Shear: A More Serious Issue

In some cases, a Craftsman Intek Plus 18 HP engine won’t crank because the flywheel key has sheared. The flywheel key is a small metal piece that connects the flywheel to the crankshaft. If the engine encounters significant resistance (like hitting a solid object with the blade), the flywheel key can shear, causing the engine to spin freely without engaging the starter.

Diagnosing a sheared flywheel key requires removing the flywheel, which is a more involved repair. If you suspect this is the problem, it’s best to consult a qualified mechanic.

## 7. Low Oil Shut-Off Sensor

Many Craftsman Intek Plus engines have a low oil shut-off sensor that prevents the engine from starting if the oil level is too low. This is a safety feature to protect the engine from damage. Check the oil level and add oil if necessary. If the oil level is sufficient, the sensor itself might be faulty and need to be replaced. You can often bypass the sensor temporarily for testing purposes, but it’s important to replace it if it’s malfunctioning.

## FAQ: Common Questions About a Craftsman Intek Plus Engine That Won't Crank

**Q: Why won’t my Craftsman Intek Plus engine crank even with a fully charged battery?**
A: A fully charged battery doesn’t guarantee a crank. The issue could be a faulty starter, a bad solenoid, a corroded connection, a safety switch problem, or a sheared flywheel key. Systematic troubleshooting is essential to pinpoint the exact cause.

**Q: How do I test the solenoid on my Craftsman Intek Plus engine?**
A: Use a multimeter to check for voltage at the solenoid when the key is turned to the start position. If there’s no voltage, the problem lies upstream (ignition switch, safety switches). If there is voltage, the solenoid itself is likely faulty.

**Q: What does it mean if my engine clicks but doesn’t crank?**
A: A clicking sound usually indicates the solenoid is engaging, but the starter motor isn’t turning. This often points to a faulty starter motor or a poor connection to the starter.

**Q: Can a bad spark plug prevent the engine from cranking?**
A: While less common, a severely fouled or damaged spark plug can sometimes create enough resistance to prevent the engine from turning over. It’s always a good idea to check the spark plug as part of your troubleshooting process.

## Conclusion

Getting your Craftsman Intek Plus 18 HP engine to crank again often involves a process of elimination. Start with the simple checks – fuel level, battery connections, and safety switches. Then, move on to testing the starter, solenoid, and ignition system. Remember to prioritize safety and disconnect the battery before working on the electrical system. If you’re uncomfortable performing any of these repairs, don’t hesitate to consult a qualified mechanic. By following these steps, you’ll be well on your way to getting your engine running smoothly and tackling your next project. Don't forget to regularly maintain your engine to prevent future issues, and consider cleaning your engine to keep it running efficiently [https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-engine-block](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-engine-block).
