## Keeping Your Hearing Clear: How to Clean Widex Hearing Aids

Do you rely on Widex hearing aids to stay connected to the world around you? Maintaining them properly is crucial for optimal performance and longevity. Cleaning your Widex hearing aids regularly removes earwax, debris, and moisture, all of which can impact sound quality and even cause malfunctions. This guide will walk you through a simple, effective routine to keep your hearing aids in top condition. We’ll cover everything from daily wiping to more thorough cleaning methods, ensuring you get the most out of your investment.

**Takeaway:**

*   Clean your Widex hearing aids daily with a soft cloth.
*   Remove the wax guard regularly.
*   Avoid water exposure and use a drying kit.
*   Never use harsh chemicals or solvents.

**Quick Answer:** To clean Widex hearing aids, wipe them daily with a soft, dry cloth. Regularly check and replace the wax guard. Avoid moisture and use a hearing aid dryer if possible. Never use liquids like alcohol or detergents.

## Why Cleaning Your Widex Hearing Aids Matters

Hearing aids are delicate electronic devices. They sit inside your ear canal, making them susceptible to damage from earwax, skin oils, and moisture.  Regular cleaning isn’t just about hygiene; it’s about preserving the functionality of your hearing aids.  Earwax and debris can block the sound outlet, leading to reduced volume or distorted sound.  Moisture can corrode the internal components, potentially causing irreversible damage.  Taking a few minutes each day to clean your Widex hearing aids can save you costly repairs or replacements down the line.

## Daily Cleaning: A Simple Routine

A daily cleaning routine is the cornerstone of hearing aid maintenance. This doesn’t require a lot of time or effort, but it makes a significant difference. Start by using a soft, dry cloth – microfiber is ideal – to wipe down the entire surface of your hearing aids. Pay particular attention to the microphone openings and the battery compartment.  This removes loose debris and prevents it from building up.  Avoid using any liquids during this daily wipe-down.  Think of it like dusting your electronics; a quick, gentle pass is all it needs.

## Replacing and Cleaning the Wax Guard

The wax guard is a small filter that protects the delicate internal components of your Widex hearing aids from earwax.  It’s designed to be replaced regularly, typically every few weeks, depending on your earwax production.  Check your hearing aid’s manual for specific instructions on how to remove and replace the wax guard.  Using a wax pick or a cleaning wire, gently remove the old wax guard.  Never force it, as this could damage the hearing aid.  Once removed, inspect the wax well for any remaining wax and carefully clean it with a soft brush.  Proper wax guard maintenance is essential for clear sound and preventing blockages.

## Dealing with Moisture: A Major Concern

Moisture is a hearing aid’s enemy. Sweat, humidity, and even accidental splashes can cause significant damage.  If your hearing aids get wet, immediately remove the batteries.  Then, place them in a drying kit or container with desiccant packets to absorb the moisture.  Never use a hairdryer or other heat source to dry your hearing aids, as this can melt or warp the components.  Consider using a hearing aid dryer nightly, especially if you live in a humid climate or sweat frequently.

## Deep Cleaning Your Widex Hearing Aids

While daily cleaning and wax guard maintenance are crucial, a more thorough cleaning should be performed periodically – perhaps once a month.  This involves carefully inspecting all crevices and removing any stubborn debris.  Use a soft-bristled brush, like a toothbrush, to gently clean around the microphone and speaker openings.  You can also use a small loop of wire to carefully remove any impacted wax.  Avoid using sharp objects that could damage the internal components.  Remember, gentle is key.

### Cleaning the Ear Mold (If Applicable)

If your Widex hearing aids use custom ear molds, these also require regular cleaning.  Detach the ear mold from the hearing aid and wash it with mild soap and warm water.  Rinse thoroughly and allow it to air dry completely before reattaching it.  Never use alcohol or harsh chemicals to clean ear molds, as these can irritate your ear canal.  Keeping your ear molds clean prevents the buildup of bacteria and ensures a comfortable fit.

## What *Not* To Do When Cleaning Your Widex Hearing Aids

Just as important as knowing *what* to do is knowing *what not* to do.  Avoid using harsh chemicals like alcohol, bleach, or detergents. These can damage the plastic and electronic components of your hearing aids.  Never submerge your hearing aids in water.  Don’t use cotton swabs, as they can push wax further into the hearing aid.  Avoid using compressed air, as it can force moisture into the device.  And finally, never attempt to disassemble your hearing aids yourself; leave repairs to a qualified audiologist.
