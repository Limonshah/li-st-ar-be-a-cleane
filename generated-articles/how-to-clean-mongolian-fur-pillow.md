## Keeping Cozy: How To Clean Your Mongolian Fur Pillow

Is your Mongolian fur pillow looking a little less fluffy and fresh? Don't worry, maintaining the luxurious feel of your pillow is easier than you think. A Mongolian fur pillow adds a touch of elegance to any space, but it requires specific care to keep it looking its best. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about cleaning your Mongolian fur pillow, from routine maintenance to tackling spills and deeper cleaning. We’ll cover the best methods to restore its softness and fluffiness, ensuring it remains a cozy haven for years to come. 

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly shake and brush your Mongolian fur pillow.
*   Spot clean spills immediately with a damp cloth.
*   Avoid fully submerging the pillow in water.
*   Use a fur-specific cleaner for deeper cleaning when needed.
*   Allow the pillow to air dry completely.

**Quick Answer:** To clean a Mongolian fur pillow, gently shake it to remove loose debris, spot clean any spills with a damp cloth and mild detergent, and brush the fur to restore its fluffiness. Avoid water saturation and always air dry.

## Understanding Mongolian Fur & Its Cleaning Needs

Mongolian fur is known for its incredibly soft and silky texture. It’s typically made from the undercoat of Mongolian sheep, which is what gives it that luxurious feel. However, this delicate nature means it requires special cleaning attention. Unlike synthetic materials, Mongolian fur can be damaged by harsh chemicals and excessive moisture. Understanding these sensitivities is the first step to properly caring for your pillow.  You want to preserve the natural oils in the fur to maintain its softness and prevent it from becoming brittle. 

## Daily & Weekly Maintenance for a Fluffy Pillow

Consistent, gentle care is the key to keeping your Mongolian fur pillow in top condition.  A little effort each week can prevent dirt and oils from building up, reducing the need for more intensive cleaning. Start by shaking your pillow gently every day to dislodge any dust or debris.  Then, once a week, use a wide-tooth comb or a brush specifically designed for fur to gently brush the fibers in the direction of the fur. This helps to maintain its fluffiness and prevent matting.  For a quick refresh, you can also hang your pillow in a well-ventilated area for a few hours.  

## Spot Cleaning Spills on Your Fur Pillow

Accidents happen! If you spill something on your Mongolian fur pillow, act quickly. The faster you address the spill, the less likely it is to stain or damage the fur. First, blot the spill with a clean, dry cloth to absorb as much liquid as possible. Avoid rubbing, as this can spread the stain and damage the fibers. Next, mix a small amount of mild detergent with cool water. Dampen a clean cloth with the solution and gently blot the stained area.  Finally, use a clean, damp cloth to rinse away any remaining detergent, and then blot dry with a clean towel.

### Dealing with Different Types of Spills

*   **Water-based spills (juice, coffee, tea):** Follow the spot cleaning method above.
*   **Oil-based spills (food, makeup):** Sprinkle a small amount of cornstarch or baking soda onto the stain to absorb the oil. Let it sit for 30 minutes, then vacuum or brush it away. Follow with the spot cleaning method.
*   **Sticky spills (honey, syrup):** Gently scrape away any excess with a dull knife or spoon. Then, follow the spot cleaning method.

## Deep Cleaning Your Mongolian Fur Pillow

While regular maintenance and spot cleaning are essential, your Mongolian fur pillow will eventually need a deeper clean. This doesn’t mean a full wash!  Submerging the pillow in water can ruin the fur and the inner filling. Instead, focus on surface cleaning. You can purchase a fur-specific cleaner, following the product’s instructions carefully. Alternatively, you can create a gentle cleaning solution by mixing a small amount of baby shampoo with cool water.  

Apply the cleaner to a clean cloth and gently wipe the fur in the direction of the fibers. Avoid saturating the pillow. Once you’ve cleaned the entire surface, use a clean, damp cloth to rinse away any remaining cleaner.

## Drying Your Mongolian Fur Pillow Properly

Proper drying is crucial to prevent damage and maintain the fur’s softness. Never put your Mongolian fur pillow in the dryer! The heat can cause the fur to become brittle and matted. Instead, gently shake out any excess water and lay the pillow flat on a clean, dry surface.  Allow it to air dry completely, which may take several hours or even a day, depending on the humidity.  

While it’s drying, periodically brush the fur to help maintain its fluffiness and prevent it from sticking together.  Avoid direct sunlight or heat, as this can also damage the fur.  Once the pillow is completely dry, give it another good brush to restore its original texture.

## Storage Tips to Preserve Your Pillow's Beauty

When you’re not using your Mongolian fur pillow, proper storage is essential to protect it from dust, dirt, and damage. Store the pillow in a breathable cotton bag or pillowcase. Avoid plastic bags, as they can trap moisture and lead to mildew.  Keep the pillow in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated area. Avoid storing it in direct sunlight or near heat sources.  

Periodically take the pillow out of storage and air it out to prevent it from becoming musty. Gently brush the fur to maintain its fluffiness.  Following these storage tips will help ensure your Mongolian fur pillow remains beautiful and cozy for years to come.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use a vacuum cleaner to clean my Mongolian fur pillow?**

**Q: How often should I deep clean my Mongolian fur pillow?**

A:  Generally, deep cleaning once or twice a year is sufficient, depending on how often you use the pillow and how quickly it gets dirty.

**Q: What if my Mongolian fur pillow gets severely stained?**

A: For severe stains, it’s best to consult a professional fur cleaner. They have the expertise and specialized cleaning solutions to safely remove stubborn stains without damaging the fur.

**Q: Can I use fabric softener on my Mongolian fur pillow?**

A: No, avoid using fabric softener. It can leave a residue on the fur and make it feel greasy and matted.
