## Tackling Mold in Your Washer: Cleaning the Detergent Dispenser

Is a musty smell lingering after laundry day? You might be dealing with mold in your front load washer, and a common culprit is the detergent dispenser. This area is prone to mold growth due to trapped moisture and residual detergent. Don't worry, though! Cleaning it is a manageable task. This article will guide you through a step-by-step process to effectively clean mold from your front load washer’s detergent dispenser, ensuring fresh and clean laundry every time. We’ll cover everything from removal to deep cleaning and preventative measures.

**Takeaway:**

*   Remove the dispenser drawer.
*   Soak it in a vinegar solution.
*   Scrub away mold with a brush.
*   Disinfect and rinse thoroughly.
*   Dry completely before reinserting.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean mold from a front load washer detergent dispenser, remove the drawer, soak it in a solution of equal parts white vinegar and water for at least 30 minutes, scrub with a brush, rinse thoroughly, and allow to air dry completely before replacing.

## Why Mold Grows in Your Detergent Dispenser

Front load washers, while efficient, are more susceptible to mold growth than top load machines. The design traps moisture, creating a perfect breeding ground for mold and mildew. The detergent dispenser, with its nooks and crannies, is particularly vulnerable. Liquid fabric softener is a major contributor, as it leaves a sticky residue that attracts mold spores. Using too much detergent, even powder, can also contribute to buildup. Understanding *why* mold grows helps you prevent it in the future. Regular cleaning is key to maintaining a hygienic washing machine.

## Removing the Detergent Dispenser Drawer

Before you can start cleaning, you need to remove the detergent dispenser drawer. This process varies slightly depending on your washer model, but it’s generally straightforward. Look for a release button or latch, usually located on the top or front of the dispenser housing. Press or slide the release mechanism while gently pulling the drawer forward. If it doesn’t budge, consult your washer’s manual for specific instructions. Once removed, you’ll have better access to all the areas where mold can hide.

## The Power of Vinegar: A Natural Cleaning Solution

White vinegar is a fantastic, natural cleaning agent, and it’s particularly effective against mold. Its acidity helps to dissolve mold spores and break down detergent buildup. Mix a solution of equal parts white vinegar and warm water. Fill a sink or large container with this solution and submerge the detergent dispenser drawer. Let it soak for at least 30 minutes, or even overnight for stubborn mold. This soaking process loosens the mold, making it easier to scrub away. Vinegar is a safe and effective alternative to harsh chemical cleaners.

## Scrubbing Away the Mold

After soaking, it’s time to get scrubbing! Use a soft-bristled brush, like an old toothbrush or a small cleaning brush, to scrub all surfaces of the dispenser drawer. Pay close attention to corners, crevices, and any areas with visible mold. For particularly stubborn mold, you can create a paste of baking soda and water and apply it to the affected areas before scrubbing. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as these can scratch the plastic. Remember to wear gloves during this process to protect your hands.

## Disinfecting and Rinsing Thoroughly

Once you’ve scrubbed away the visible mold, it’s important to disinfect the dispenser drawer. You can use a diluted bleach solution (1 tablespoon of bleach per 1 cup of water), but be cautious and ensure proper ventilation. Alternatively, you can use a commercial disinfectant spray. Apply the disinfectant to all surfaces and let it sit for a few minutes. Then, rinse the dispenser drawer thoroughly with clean water, ensuring all traces of vinegar, bleach, or disinfectant are removed. Residual cleaning agents can cause irritation or damage your clothes.

## Drying and Reassembly: Preventing Future Growth

The final, and arguably most important, step is to dry the dispenser drawer completely. Mold thrives in damp environments, so ensuring everything is dry is crucial for preventing regrowth. Use a clean towel to wipe down the drawer, and then let it air dry completely before reinserting it into the washer. You can also leave it in a sunny spot to speed up the drying process. Before reassembling, wipe down the inside of the dispenser housing with a clean, dry cloth. To prevent future mold growth, leave the dispenser drawer open after each wash to allow it to air out.
