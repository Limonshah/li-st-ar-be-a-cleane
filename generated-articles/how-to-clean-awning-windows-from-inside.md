## Sparkling Clean: How To Clean Awning Windows From Inside

Have you noticed your awning windows looking a little dull? Cleaning awning windows can seem tricky, especially from the inside, but it doesn’t have to be a chore. This guide will walk you through the best methods for achieving streak-free, sparkling clean awning windows without needing to climb outside. We’ll cover everything from the tools you’ll need to step-by-step instructions, ensuring your view is always clear. Let's get started and make your windows shine!

**Takeaway:**

*   Gather your cleaning supplies: microfiber cloths, window cleaner, and a long-handled tool.
*   Protect your floors and surrounding areas from drips.
*   Clean in sections, working from top to bottom.
*   Dry thoroughly to prevent streaks.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean awning windows from inside, use a microfiber cloth attached to a long-handled tool, spray with window cleaner, wipe down the glass, and dry with a clean, dry microfiber cloth. This method allows you to reach all areas of the window safely and effectively.

## Understanding Your Awning Windows

Awning windows open outward, hinged at the top, making them a bit different to clean than traditional windows. This design is great for ventilation, even during light rain, but it also means dirt and grime can accumulate in hard-to-reach spots. Knowing how your windows operate is the first step to cleaning them effectively. Understanding the window’s mechanics will help you avoid damaging the hinges or locking mechanisms during the cleaning process. 

## Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Before you begin, having the right tools makes all the difference. You won’t need anything fancy, just a few essential items. A good quality window cleaner is key, but you can also make your own using a mixture of vinegar and water. Microfiber cloths are essential for streak-free cleaning, and a long-handled tool will help you reach the entire window surface. 

Here’s a checklist:

*   Window cleaner (commercial or DIY)
*   Microfiber cloths (several)
*   Long-handled duster or window cleaning tool
*   Spray bottle (if making your own cleaner)
*   Bucket of warm water (optional, for rinsing cloths)
*   Drop cloth or old towels (to protect floors)

## The Best Cleaning Solution for Awning Windows

Choosing the right cleaning solution is important for both effectiveness and safety. Commercial window cleaners are readily available, but a homemade solution can be just as effective and more environmentally friendly. A simple mixture of equal parts white vinegar and water works wonders for cutting through grime and leaving a streak-free shine. If you're dealing with stubborn dirt or grease, you can add a drop of dish soap to the mixture.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Awning Windows

Now for the main event! Here’s how to clean your awning windows from the inside, step-by-step:

1.  **Prepare the Area:** Lay down a drop cloth or old towels to protect your floors from drips.
2.  **Dust First:** Use a long-handled duster to remove loose dirt and debris from the window surface. This prevents you from spreading grime around when you start cleaning.
3.  **Apply the Cleaner:** Spray your chosen window cleaner onto a clean microfiber cloth – *not* directly onto the window. This prevents overspray and potential damage to the window frame.
4.  **Wipe Down the Glass:** Attach the microfiber cloth to your long-handled tool and carefully wipe down the window glass, working from top to bottom. Overlap your strokes to ensure you cover the entire surface.
5.  **Dry Thoroughly:** Use a clean, dry microfiber cloth attached to your long-handled tool to dry the window immediately after cleaning. This prevents streaks and water spots.
6.  **Repeat if Necessary:** For particularly dirty windows, you may need to repeat the cleaning process.

## Tackling Stubborn Spots and Grime

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, stubborn spots and grime remain. For these, a little extra attention is needed. A paste made from baking soda and water can be effective for removing stuck-on dirt. Apply the paste to the spot, let it sit for a few minutes, then gently scrub with a soft cloth. If you're dealing with mold or mildew, especially in humid climates, you might need a specialized mold remover.

## Maintaining Clean Awning Windows

Regular cleaning is the key to keeping your awning windows looking their best. Aim to clean them at least twice a year, or more often if you live in a dusty or polluted area. Quick wipe-downs between deep cleans can also help prevent grime from building up.
