## Keeping Your Phonak Hearing Aids in Top Shape

Do you want to ensure your Phonak hearing aids deliver the clearest possible sound? Regular cleaning is essential for maintaining their performance and extending their lifespan.  Dirt, wax, and debris can build up, causing discomfort, reduced sound quality, and even malfunction. This guide will walk you through a simple, effective routine to keep your Phonak hearing aids working their best. We’ll cover everything from daily wiping to more thorough cleaning methods, ensuring you can enjoy consistent, reliable hearing.

**Takeaway:**

*   Clean your hearing aids daily with a soft cloth.
*   Remove the wax guard regularly (if applicable).
*   Avoid water and harsh chemicals.
*   Schedule professional cleaning with your audiologist.

**Quick Answer:** To clean Phonak hearing aids, gently wipe them daily with a soft, dry cloth. Remove the wax guard if your model has one, and clean the vent with a wax pick. Never use water, solvents, or abrasive cleaners.



## Why Cleaning Your Phonak Hearing Aids Matters

Hearing aids are delicate electronic devices that sit inside your ear canal.  This means they’re constantly exposed to earwax, moisture, and other debris.  Ignoring this buildup can lead to several problems, impacting both the functionality and your comfort.  Regular cleaning prevents these issues and ensures you get the most out of your investment. 

*   **Improved Sound Quality:** Wax and debris can block the sound outlet, muffling sounds and reducing clarity.
*   **Preventing Malfunctions:** Moisture can corrode the internal components, leading to costly repairs.
*   **Comfort and Hygiene:**  Removing earwax prevents irritation and potential infections.
*   **Extended Lifespan:**  Proper care extends the life of your hearing aids, saving you money in the long run.

## Daily Cleaning: A Simple Routine

Establishing a daily cleaning routine is the easiest way to prevent significant buildup. This doesn’t require much time or effort, but it makes a huge difference.  Think of it like brushing your teeth – a small daily habit with big benefits.  

*   **Use a Soft, Dry Cloth:** Gently wipe the surface of your hearing aids with a clean, soft cloth. Microfiber cloths work well because they don’t leave lint behind.
*   **Focus on the Microphone and Battery Compartment:** Pay special attention to these areas, as they are prone to collecting debris.
*   **Avoid Moisture:** Never use water or cleaning solutions directly on your hearing aids.
*   **Store Properly:** When not in use, store your hearing aids in a dry, ventilated case.



## Cleaning Phonak Hearing Aids with Wax Guards

Many Phonak hearing aids utilize wax guards to protect the internal components from earwax. These guards need to be checked and replaced regularly.  If you notice a decrease in sound quality or a blockage, it’s likely time for a new wax guard.

*   **Locate the Wax Guard:**  The wax guard is typically a small, cylindrical filter located in the sound outlet of the hearing aid.
*   **Remove the Old Guard:** Use a wax pick or a dedicated wax guard removal tool (often provided with your hearing aids) to gently remove the old guard.
*   **Insert a New Guard:**  Insert a new wax guard until it clicks into place.
*   **Regular Inspection:** Check the wax guard every few days, and replace it as needed.

## Deep Cleaning Your Phonak Hearing Aids

While daily wiping is crucial, a more thorough cleaning should be performed periodically. This helps remove stubborn wax and debris that may have accumulated in hard-to-reach areas.  

*   **Use a Cleaning Brush:** A small, soft-bristled brush can help dislodge wax from vents and crevices.
*   **Wax Pick for Vents:** Carefully use a wax pick to clear any blockage in the vents. Be gentle to avoid damaging the delicate components.
*   **Cleaning Loops:** Some audiologists recommend using cleaning loops to remove wax.
*   **Avoid Solvents and Abrasives:** Never use alcohol, bleach, or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the hearing aids.



## Cleaning Different Phonak Hearing Aid Styles

Phonak offers a variety of hearing aid styles, and the cleaning process may vary slightly depending on the model.  Here’s a breakdown for some common styles:

*   **Behind-the-Ear (BTE):**  Focus on cleaning the tubing and earmold.  Detach the earmold and clean it separately with mild soap and water.
*   **Receiver-in-the-Ear (RIE):**  Clean the receiver wire and the dome.  Replace the dome regularly, as it can accumulate wax.
*   **In-the-Ear (ITE):**  Gently wipe the surface with a soft cloth and use a wax pick to clean the vents.
*   **Completely-in-the-Canal (CIC):**  These are the most delicate and require extra care.  Avoid getting moisture inside the shell.

## What *Not* To Do When Cleaning Your Phonak Hearing Aids

Knowing what *not* to do is just as important as knowing what *to* do.  Incorrect cleaning methods can cause irreversible damage to your hearing aids. 

*   **Don’t Use Water:** Water can damage the electronic components.
*   **Don’t Use Harsh Chemicals:** Avoid alcohol, bleach, solvents, and abrasive cleaners.
*   **Don’t Disassemble the Hearing Aid:**  Unless you are specifically instructed by your audiologist, do not attempt to disassemble your hearing aids.
*   **Don’t Use Cotton Swabs:** Cotton swabs can push wax further into the hearing aid.
*   **Don’t Ignore Professional Cleaning:**  Regular check-ups and professional cleaning are essential for maintaining optimal performance.
