## Keeping Your Engine Breathing: How To Clean The Roush Air Filter

Is your Mustang feeling a little sluggish? One often-overlooked maintenance item that can significantly impact performance is your air filter. Specifically, if you’ve upgraded to a Roush air filter, knowing how to clean it properly is crucial. A dirty air filter restricts airflow to your engine, reducing horsepower and fuel efficiency. This guide will walk you through the process of cleaning your Roush air filter, ensuring your Mustang continues to perform at its best. We’ll cover everything from gathering supplies to the final inspection, so you can confidently maintain this important component.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly cleaning your Roush air filter improves engine performance.
*   Proper cleaning extends the filter’s lifespan, saving you money.
*   Following these steps ensures optimal airflow and engine protection.

A clean Roush air filter allows your engine to breathe easily, maximizing power and fuel economy. It’s a simple maintenance task that can yield significant benefits. Let’s dive into the details.

## Why Clean Your Roush Air Filter?

Roush air filters are designed for enhanced performance, offering increased airflow compared to stock filters. However, this increased airflow also means they can collect more dirt and debris. Unlike disposable paper filters, Roush filters are typically reusable, constructed from oiled cotton gauze. This makes cleaning a viable and cost-effective alternative to frequent replacements. Cleaning your filter restores airflow, preventing a drop in horsepower and maintaining optimal fuel efficiency. Ignoring this maintenance can lead to reduced engine performance and potentially even engine damage over time. 

## What You’ll Need to Clean Your Roush Air Filter

Before you begin, gather the necessary supplies. Having everything on hand will make the process smoother and more efficient. You’ll need:

*   Roush Air Filter Cleaner (specifically formulated for oiled filters)
*   Roush Air Filter Oil (to re-oil the filter after cleaning)
*   Warm water
*   A clean bucket or sink
*   Soft-bristled brush (an old toothbrush works well)
*   Clean rags or towels
*   Gloves (optional, to keep your hands clean)

Using the correct cleaning and oiling products is vital. Avoid harsh chemicals or solvents, as these can damage the filter material. You can find Roush-specific cleaning kits online or at automotive retailers.

## Step-by-Step: Cleaning Your Roush Air Filter

Now, let's get to the cleaning process. Follow these steps carefully for best results.

1.  **Remove the Filter:** Carefully remove the Roush air filter from your Mustang’s air intake housing. Be gentle to avoid damaging the housing or the filter itself.
2.  **Initial Rinse:** Gently rinse the filter with warm water to remove loose dirt and debris. Rinse from the *clean side* (the side that faces the engine) to avoid pushing dirt further into the filter media.
3.  **Apply Cleaner:** Apply the Roush Air Filter Cleaner liberally to the *dirty side* of the filter. Let it soak for about 10-15 minutes. This allows the cleaner to break down the dirt and oil.
4.  **Gentle Scrubbing:** Using a soft-bristled brush, gently scrub the filter media in the direction of the pleats. Avoid excessive force, as this can damage the delicate cotton gauze.
5.  **Rinse Again:** Rinse the filter thoroughly with warm water, again from the clean side, until the water runs clear. Ensure all traces of cleaner are removed.
6.  **Air Dry:** Allow the filter to air dry completely. *Do not* use compressed air or a heat source to speed up the drying process, as this can damage the filter. This can take several hours, or even overnight.

## Re-Oiling Your Roush Air Filter

Once the filter is completely dry, it’s time to re-oil it. This is a crucial step, as the oil helps trap dirt and debris, maximizing filtration efficiency.

1.  **Apply Oil:** Apply the Roush Air Filter Oil evenly to the *dirty side* of the filter. Use a light, even coat – avoid saturating the filter.
2.  **Allow to Soak:** Let the oil soak into the filter media for about 20-30 minutes. This allows the oil to distribute evenly throughout the filter.
3.  **Inspect and Repeat (If Necessary):** Inspect the filter for any dry spots. If you find any, apply a small amount of oil to those areas. You want the filter to be evenly coated, but not dripping with oil.
4.  **Final Inspection:** Before reinstalling, double-check that the filter is completely dry and evenly oiled.

Proper oiling is essential for optimal performance. If you're unsure about the process, consider watching a video tutorial or consulting a professional.

## Reinstalling and Maintaining Your Filter

With your Roush air filter cleaned and re-oiled, it’s time to reinstall it. Carefully place the filter back into the air intake housing, ensuring a proper seal. Double-check that all clamps and fasteners are secure. 

To maintain optimal performance, inspect your air filter regularly – ideally every month or after driving in dusty conditions. Cleaning frequency will depend on your driving environment. If you frequently drive on dirt roads or in dusty areas, you’ll need to clean your filter more often.

*   **Can I use any air filter oil?** No, always use a filter oil specifically designed for oiled cotton gauze filters, like Roush Air Filter Oil. Other oils may not provide adequate filtration or could damage the filter.
*   **What happens if I over-oil the filter?** Over-oiling can attract more dirt and potentially damage your mass airflow sensor. Ensure the filter is evenly coated but not dripping with oil.

*   **Is it okay to use compressed air to dry the filter?** No, compressed air can damage the delicate filter media. Allow the filter to air dry completely.
