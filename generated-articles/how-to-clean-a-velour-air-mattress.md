## Keeping it Cozy: How To Clean A Velour Air Mattress

Is your velour air mattress looking a little less fresh than it used to? Don't worry, it happens! Velour, while incredibly comfortable, can be a bit tricky to clean. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to effectively clean your velour air mattress, removing stains, odors, and keeping it a welcoming sleep surface. We’ll cover everything from quick spot cleaning to a more thorough deep clean. Let's get started and restore your air mattress to its plush best!

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly vacuum your velour air mattress.
*   Address spills immediately with a gentle cleaning solution.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals that can damage the velour.
*   Ensure the mattress is completely dry before storing.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean a velour air mattress, vacuum it thoroughly, spot clean stains with a mild detergent and water solution, and gently blot (don't rub!).  Allow it to air dry completely before storing.

## Understanding Velour & Cleaning Considerations

Velour is a plush fabric known for its soft, velvety texture. It’s created with a special weaving technique that gives it a luxurious feel. However, this texture also means it can trap dust, dirt, and spills more easily than smoother materials. When cleaning a velour air mattress, it’s crucial to be gentle. Harsh chemicals or abrasive scrubbing can damage the fibers and ruin the soft texture.  Always test any cleaning solution in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t cause discoloration or damage.  

## Step-by-Step: Routine Cleaning & Dust Removal

Regular maintenance is key to keeping your velour air mattress clean. A quick routine can prevent dirt and dust from building up and becoming difficult to remove. Start by deflating the mattress slightly to make cleaning easier. Then, use the upholstery attachment on your vacuum cleaner to thoroughly vacuum the entire surface. Pay special attention to seams and crevices where dust tends to accumulate.  

*   Vacuum weekly for light use.
*   Increase frequency if the mattress is used often or in a dusty environment.
*   Consider using a handheld vacuum for smaller areas and tight spots.

For a deeper clean, you can sprinkle baking soda over the surface, let it sit for 15-30 minutes, and then vacuum it up. This helps to absorb odors and freshen the fabric.

## Tackling Fresh Stains on Your Velour Mattress

Accidents happen! When a spill occurs, act quickly. The faster you address the stain, the easier it will be to remove. First, blot up as much of the liquid as possible with a clean, dry cloth. Avoid rubbing, as this can spread the stain and push it deeper into the fibers. Next, prepare a mild cleaning solution by mixing a small amount of gentle dish soap with lukewarm water. 

*   Dip a clean cloth into the solution and gently blot the stain.
*   Work from the outside of the stain inward to prevent it from spreading.
*   Rinse the cloth with clean water and blot the area again to remove any soap residue. 
*   If you're dealing with a stubborn stain, you might consider using a carpet cleaner, but always test it first.  You can learn more about [how to clean a mattress with carpet cleaner](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mattress-with-carpet-cleaner) for guidance.

## Dealing with Tougher, Set-In Stains

Sometimes, stains aren't caught right away. For set-in stains on your velour air mattress, you may need a slightly more powerful approach. A solution of equal parts white vinegar and water can be effective. Again, test this solution in an inconspicuous area first. Apply the solution to the stain, let it sit for 5-10 minutes, and then gently blot with a clean cloth. 

*   For protein-based stains (like blood or milk), use cold water. Hot water can set the stain.
*   For grease-based stains, sprinkle baking soda on the area to absorb the grease before applying the cleaning solution.
*   If the stain persists, repeat the process or consider consulting a professional cleaning service.  

Remember, patience is key! Don't scrub aggressively, as this can damage the velour.  If you're also concerned about cleaning other types of mattresses, like those found in dorm rooms, check out our article on [how to clean a dorm mattress](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-dorm-mattress).

## Eliminating Odors from Your Velour Air Mattress

Even after cleaning, your velour air mattress might retain odors. Baking soda is your friend here! Sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda over the entire surface of the mattress and let it sit for several hours, or even overnight. This will help to absorb any lingering odors. Vacuum up the baking soda thoroughly. 

*   For particularly stubborn odors, you can mix a few drops of essential oil (like lavender or tea tree oil) with the baking soda before sprinkling it on the mattress.
*   Ensure the room is well-ventilated while the baking soda is sitting on the mattress.
*   Sunlight can also help to eliminate odors, so if possible, air out the mattress outdoors on a dry, sunny day.

## Drying & Storage: Protecting Your Investment

Proper drying is crucial to prevent mold and mildew growth. After cleaning, allow the velour air mattress to air dry completely. This may take several hours, depending on the humidity and temperature. Avoid using a hairdryer or other heat source, as this can damage the velour. 

*   Ensure the mattress is completely dry before inflating and storing it.
*   Store the mattress in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.
*   Consider using a mattress protector to help keep it clean and protected during storage.
*   If you're unsure about using certain cleaning products, you can always check if [you can use a carpet cleaner on a mattress](https://www.beacleaner.com/can-you-use-a-carpet-cleaner-on-a-mattress) for more information.
