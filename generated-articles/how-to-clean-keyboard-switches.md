To clean keyboard switches, first unplug your device and remove keycaps. Use compressed air to blast out loose debris. For deeper grime, use isopropyl alcohol with cotton swabs or a fine brush to clean around the switch housing. This removes stickiness and improves key response.

## 1. Why Clean Your Keyboard Switches?

Your keyboard takes a lot of daily use. Each key press involves a tiny mechanical switch. Over time, these switches collect unwanted material. This build-up affects how your keyboard feels. It can even stop keys from working.

Think about how much dust collects in your home. Your keyboard, especially the switches, is a prime spot for it. Food crumbs, pet hair, and skin cells find their way into the tiny gaps. Drinks spilling can leave sticky residues. These things make your keys feel gritty or unresponsive. A sticky key means your switch is dirty. Cleaning it can fix this.

A clean switch ensures each keystroke registers correctly. It feels smooth and consistent. This improves your typing experience. Regular cleaning also prevents damage. It stops dirt from grinding against switch components. This extends the life of your keyboard. You invest in a good keyboard. Keeping it clean protects that investment.

For example, a dirty switch might register multiple presses. Or it might not register any press at all. This is frustrating for typing or gaming. Cleaning resolves these issues. It brings back that satisfying click or smooth linear feel. Investing a little time now saves you frustration and money later.

## 2. Essential Tools for Cleaning Keyboard Switches

Cleaning keyboard switches requires the right tools. Having everything ready makes the job easier. It also ensures you clean effectively and safely. You likely have many of these items already.

First, you need a keycap puller. This tool lets you remove keycaps without damage. It is much safer than using your fingers or a screwdriver. Most mechanical keyboards come with one. If not, they are inexpensive and easy to find. Next, get some compressed air. This is perfect for blasting out loose debris. It reaches places a brush cannot. Make sure to use short bursts. Holding the can upside down can release propellant liquid.

You will also need isopropyl alcohol (IPA). IPA evaporates quickly and leaves no residue. Use 70% or 90% strength. Cotton swabs or small micro-fiber cloths work well with IPA. They help clean around the switch housing. A soft brush, like a clean paintbrush or a dedicated keyboard brush, is useful. It sweeps away dust before deeper cleaning. For stubborn grime, small precision tools like dental picks can help. They reach into tight spots.

Consider a small container for removed keycaps. This stops them from getting lost. A flashlight also helps. It illuminates dark areas inside the keyboard. Finally, a small non-static mat can protect your workspace. This prevents static discharge during deep cleaning. Gathering these tools makes you ready for the cleaning process.

## 3. Preparing Your Keyboard for Switch Cleaning

Preparation is key to a successful cleaning session. Proper setup protects your keyboard. It also makes the cleaning process more efficient. Do not rush this important step.

Start by unplugging your keyboard. This is crucial for safety. You do not want power running through the board while cleaning. It prevents accidental key presses. It also eliminates the risk of electrical short circuits. Next, take a picture of your keyboard. This acts as a map for reassembly. Keycaps must go back in their correct places. A photo makes putting them back much easier.

Now, begin removing the keycaps. Use your keycap puller for this. Hook the puller onto opposite sides of a keycap. Pull straight up with gentle, even force. Avoid wiggling or twisting. This can damage the keycap or the switch stem. Place removed keycaps in a bowl. You can [clean your keys on your keyboard](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-keys-on-keyboard) separately while the board dries. Keep track of larger keys like the spacebar and Shift. These often have stabilizers. They need careful removal and reattachment.

Once all keycaps are off, give the keyboard a general clean. Turn it upside down and shake it gently. This dislodges larger crumbs. Then, use compressed air to blow out loose debris. Point the nozzle at an angle. Work across the entire board. This initial cleaning removes surface dirt. It prepares the switches for more detailed attention. If you just need a quick tidy, you can even [clean your keyboard without removing keys](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-keyboard-without-removing-keys).

## 4. Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Keyboard Switches

With keycaps removed and initial debris cleared, you are ready to clean the switches themselves. This process focuses on the accessible parts of the switch. It removes most common grime.

First, identify the switch type. Most mechanical keyboards use individual switches. Each switch has a stem and a housing. Dirt often gathers around the stem. Use compressed air again, focusing on each individual switch. Hold the nozzle close but not touching. Blast around the stem from different angles. This helps dislodge smaller particles. Turn the keyboard around to ensure you hit all sides.

Next, use isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and cotton swabs. Dip a cotton swab into the IPA. Make sure it is damp, not dripping. Gently wipe around the outside of the switch housing. Clean the gaps around the switch stem. This removes sticky residues. Be careful not to let excess liquid drip into the switch itself. If the cotton swab gets dirty, use a new one. Repeat this for every switch. Pay extra attention to any keys that felt sticky before cleaning.

For deeper crevices, use a fine brush. Dip the brush in IPA. Gently scrub around the switch stem. The bristles can reach into tiny spaces. They loosen stubborn dirt. You can also use a small precision tool or a clean dental pick. Carefully scrape away hardened grime around the switch. Always be gentle. You do not want to bend or break the switch stem or housing. This step-by-step approach ensures thorough surface cleaning.

## 5. Deep Cleaning Individual Keyboard Switches

Sometimes, surface cleaning is not enough. A deeply sticky or malfunctioning switch might need individual attention. This involves opening the switch itself. This process is more involved. It requires careful handling.

First, determine if your switches are hot-swappable or soldered. Hot-swappable keyboards allow you to pull switches out. You use a switch puller for this. Soldered switches are permanently attached. You cannot easily remove them without desoldering. For soldered keyboards, you might need to clean the switch while it is still on the board. This is harder but still possible. For hot-swappable switches, gently pull the affected switch out using your switch puller. Place it on a clean surface.

If you can remove the switch, you can open it. Many mechanical switches have clips on the top and bottom. Use a small, flat-head screwdriver or a switch opener tool. Carefully pry open the clips. Separate the top housing from the bottom housing. Inside, you will find the stem, spring, and sometimes a leaf. Be careful not to lose these tiny parts. They can easily spring away.

Once open, clean each component. Wipe the stem with IPA and a microfiber cloth. Clean the inside of both housing parts. Use IPA and a cotton swab or a small brush. Pay attention to any gunk on the metal leaf. This part connects the circuit. Clean the spring if it looks dirty. Let all parts air dry completely. Ensure no liquid remains before reassembly. This deep cleaning targets the root cause of stickiness.

## 6. Lubricating Your Keyboard Switches (Optional Step)

Lubricating keyboard switches is an advanced step. It is not always necessary for cleaning. But it greatly improves typing feel. It reduces friction and sound. If you are already deep cleaning switches, this is a good time to consider it.

First, choose the right lubricant. Do not use WD-40 or similar oils. These can damage plastics. Instead, use specialized keyboard switch lubricants. Krytox GPL 205g0 is popular for linear switches. Thicker lubricants work for tactile switches. These lubricants are designed for plastic-on-plastic contact. They are safe for switch components. Get a very fine brush for application. A small paintbrush works well.

Lubrication involves applying a thin layer of grease. You apply it to specific parts of the switch. These parts include the switch stem. Apply to the rails where the stem slides. Also, apply a tiny amount to the spring. A little goes a long way. Too much lubricant can make switches feel mushy. It can even attract more dust. Use the fine brush to pick up a tiny bit of lube. Brush it onto the stem's sides. Apply it to the inside of the switch housing where the stem travels.

Lubing the spring can reduce spring ping noise. Carefully apply a thin coat to the top and bottom of the spring. You can also drop the spring into a small bag with lubricant and shake it. This "bag lubing" coats the spring evenly. Reassemble the switch after lubrication. Ensure all parts are correctly aligned. This optional step makes your clean switches feel incredibly smooth. It enhances your typing experience.

## 7. Reassembly and Testing Your Clean Keyboard

After cleaning and optionally lubricating your switches, it is time for reassembly. This step brings your keyboard back to life. Careful reassembly ensures everything works correctly. Do not rush this final part.

First, ensure all switches are fully closed and clipped. If you opened individual switches, check that the top and bottom housings are securely fastened. If you removed hot-swappable switches, gently push them back into their slots. They should click firmly into place. Ensure they are oriented correctly. The LED cutout usually faces north on most keyboards.

Now, begin placing the keycaps back. Refer to the photo you took earlier. This helps you put each keycap in its correct position. Start with the alphanumeric keys. They are usually the easiest. For larger keys like the spacebar, Shift, and Enter, you might need to reattach stabilizers first. Stabilizers ensure these wider keys press down evenly. Make sure the stabilizer wires hook into the keycap. Then align the keycap with the switch and press down firmly. You will hear a soft click as it snaps onto the switch stem.

Once all keycaps are back on, plug your keyboard back into your computer. Test every single key. Open a text editor or a keyboard testing website. Type every letter, number, and symbol. Check that each key registers correctly. Press each key several times. Listen for any odd sounds. Feel for any stickiness. This final test ensures your cleaning process was successful. If any key feels off, re-examine its switch. This thorough testing guarantees your keyboard is ready for use.
