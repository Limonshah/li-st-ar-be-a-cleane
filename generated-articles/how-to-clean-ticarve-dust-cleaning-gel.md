Ticarve Dust Cleaning Gel is a non-toxic, biodegradable gel designed to lift and trap dust, dirt, and debris.

## Preparing to Use Your Ticarve Dust Cleaning Gel

Before you start tackling dust, a little preparation goes a long way. First, ensure the area you’re cleaning is free of any loose items that could get stuck in the gel.  Next, open the Ticarve Dust Cleaning Gel container and carefully remove the gel. Avoid tearing or stretching the gel excessively, as this can reduce its effectiveness.  Finally, familiarize yourself with the texture – it should be slightly tacky but not overly sticky.

## How to Effectively Use Ticarve Dust Cleaning Gel

Using Ticarve Dust Cleaning Gel is surprisingly straightforward. Gently roll the gel across the dusty surface, applying light pressure.  Avoid pressing too hard, as this can leave residue.  As the gel rolls, it will pick up dust and debris, becoming darker in color. Continue rolling until the area appears clean.  For tight spaces, like keyboard crevices, gently press the gel into the area and then lift it straight up.

## Dealing with Heavily Dusted Areas

Sometimes, a light roll isn’t enough. If you’re tackling a heavily dusted area, work in smaller sections.  Repeatedly roll the gel over the same spot, lifting and repositioning it to a clean area each time.  You may need to use multiple portions of the gel to thoroughly clean the surface. Don’t be afraid to gently knead the gel to expose a fresh, clean surface.  Remember, patience is key!  For stubborn dust, consider combining this method with a quick wipe down using a microfiber cloth.

## Disposing of Your Used Ticarve Dust Cleaning Gel

Once the Ticarve Dust Cleaning Gel is saturated with dust, it’s time to dispose of it.  Do *not* attempt to reuse the gel once it’s lost its stickiness.  Carefully fold the used gel onto itself to contain the dust.  Then, dispose of it in a sealed plastic bag in your trash.  Proper disposal prevents dust from escaping back into the air.  It's important to maintain a clean environment, and that includes proper disposal of cleaning materials.
