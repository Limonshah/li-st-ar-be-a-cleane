## Keeping Your Feet Happy: How To Clean Oofos

Are your Oofos sandals starting to look a little less than fresh? Don't worry, it happens! These incredibly comfortable recovery sandals are designed for daily wear, and that means they’re bound to pick up dirt, grime, and odors along the way. Fortunately, cleaning your Oofos is surprisingly simple. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to keep your Oofos looking and feeling their best, ensuring they continue to provide the support and comfort you love. We’ll cover everything from quick rinses to deeper cleaning methods, so you can confidently maintain your favorite footwear.

**Takeaway:**

*   Use mild soap and lukewarm water for regular cleaning.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive cleaners.
*   Air dry your Oofos completely, away from direct heat.
*   Address odors with a baking soda solution or specialized shoe deodorizer.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean Oofos, simply wash them with mild soap and lukewarm water, gently scrub with a soft brush, and rinse thoroughly. Air dry completely, avoiding direct sunlight or heat. This simple process will keep your Oofos fresh and comfortable.

## Understanding Oofos Material & Cleaning Needs

Oofos are made from a unique OOfoam™ technology, a closed-cell foam that absorbs 37% more impact than traditional EVA foam. This makes them fantastic for recovery after workouts or long days on your feet. However, this material requires a specific cleaning approach. Unlike leather or canvas shoes, you can’t use harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners on Oofos without damaging the foam.  Using the wrong products can cause the material to break down or discolor.  Knowing the material is key to keeping them in great shape.

## The Simple Daily Clean: Rinsing Your Oofos

For a quick refresh after each wear, a simple rinse is often all you need. This is especially helpful if you’ve been wearing your Oofos at the beach or pool.  Just hold your Oofos under lukewarm running water, gently removing any loose dirt or sand. You can use your fingers or a soft cloth to help dislodge debris.  This prevents buildup and keeps them smelling fresh.  Think of it like a quick shower for your sandals!

## Deep Cleaning Your Oofos: A Step-by-Step Guide

Sometimes, a rinse just isn’t enough. If your Oofos are visibly dirty or have a lingering odor, a deeper clean is necessary. Here’s how to do it:

1.  **Prepare Your Cleaning Solution:** Mix a small amount of mild soap (like dish soap or laundry detergent) with lukewarm water. Avoid anything with bleach or strong chemicals.
2.  **Gentle Scrubbing:** Dip a soft brush (an old toothbrush works well!) into the soapy water and gently scrub the entire surface of your Oofos. Pay attention to areas with visible dirt or grime.
3.  **Thorough Rinse:** Rinse your Oofos thoroughly under lukewarm running water, ensuring all soap residue is removed. Soap left behind can attract dirt and cause discomfort.
4.  **Air Dry:** Allow your Oofos to air dry completely in a well-ventilated area. Avoid direct sunlight or heat, as this can damage the foam.

## Tackling Stubborn Stains on Your Oofos

Even with regular cleaning, stubborn stains can sometimes appear. For these, a little extra effort is required.  A paste made from baking soda and water can be surprisingly effective. Apply the paste to the stain, let it sit for 15-20 minutes, then gently scrub with a soft brush and rinse thoroughly.  For particularly tough stains, you might consider a specialized foam cleaner designed for athletic shoes – always test in an inconspicuous area first.

## Eliminating Odors From Your Oofos

Oofos, being worn without socks often, can sometimes develop an odor. Luckily, there are several ways to combat this. Baking soda is your friend! Sprinkle baking soda inside your Oofos and let it sit overnight to absorb odors.  You can also use a specialized shoe deodorizer spray.  Another option is to place your Oofos in a sealed bag with a few dryer sheets for a few hours.  Maintaining a clean home environment can also help reduce odors; consider learning [how to clean a basement](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-basement) to eliminate odor sources.

## Proper Storage to Maintain Your Oofos

How you store your Oofos can also impact their cleanliness and longevity. Avoid storing them in direct sunlight or in a hot, humid environment.  A cool, dry place is ideal.  Don’t stack heavy items on top of them, as this can compress the foam.  Proper storage helps maintain their shape and prevents the buildup of mildew or odors.
