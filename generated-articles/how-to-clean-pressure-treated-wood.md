## Keeping Your Investment Beautiful: How to Clean Pressure Treated Wood

Have you noticed your beautiful pressure-treated wood deck, fence, or siding looking a little dull and weathered? Don't worry, it's a common issue! Pressure treated wood, while durable, is still susceptible to dirt, mildew, and algae growth. Learning [how to clean pressure treated wood](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-pressure-treated-wood) is essential for maintaining its appearance and extending its lifespan. This article will guide you through everything you need to know, from gentle cleaning solutions to more intensive restoration techniques. We’ll cover the best methods, tools, and preventative measures to keep your outdoor wood looking its best for years to come.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning prevents buildup of damaging substances.
*   Mild soap and water are often sufficient for routine maintenance.
*   A pressure washer can be effective, but requires caution.
*   Wood brighteners restore the wood’s natural color.
*   Sealing or staining protects the wood from future damage.

**Quick Answer:** To clean pressure treated wood, start with a gentle scrub using dish soap and water. For tougher stains, use a wood cleaner or a pressure washer on a low setting. Always rinse thoroughly and consider applying a wood brightener and sealant to protect the wood.

## Understanding Pressure Treated Wood & Cleaning Needs

Pressure treated wood is lumber that has been chemically processed to resist rot, decay, and insect damage. This makes it ideal for outdoor projects, but the treatment itself doesn’t make it maintenance-free. Over time, exposure to the elements can lead to a buildup of dirt, mildew, and algae, giving the wood a gray or greenish tint. Regular cleaning is crucial to remove these contaminants and prevent them from causing lasting damage.  Ignoring this can lead to costly repairs or replacements down the road.

## Gentle Cleaning: Soap, Water, and a Scrub Brush

For routine maintenance, a simple solution of dish soap and water is often all you need. This method is perfect for removing light dirt and grime without damaging the wood fibers. Start by sweeping away any loose debris, like leaves or twigs. Then, mix a few tablespoons of dish soap with a gallon of warm water.  Apply the solution to the wood surface with a scrub brush, working in the direction of the wood grain. Rinse thoroughly with a garden hose, ensuring all soap residue is removed.

## The Power of a Pressure Washer: Use with Caution

A pressure washer can be a highly effective tool for cleaning pressure treated wood, especially for larger areas like decks. However, it's important to use it with caution. High pressure can damage the wood fibers, leading to splintering or etching. Always start with a low-pressure nozzle and test a small, inconspicuous area first. Keep the nozzle moving and maintain a consistent distance from the wood surface.  If you're unsure, consider hiring a professional.

### Choosing the Right Nozzle

Selecting the correct nozzle is vital when using a pressure washer on pressure treated wood. A wide-angle nozzle (40-degree or wider) distributes the water pressure over a larger area, reducing the risk of damage. Avoid using narrow-angle nozzles (0-degree or 15-degree), as they concentrate the pressure and can easily harm the wood.

## Restoring Color: Using Wood Brighteners

Even after cleaning, pressure treated wood can sometimes retain a grayish appearance. This is where a wood brightener comes in handy. Wood brighteners contain oxalic acid, which helps to restore the wood’s natural color by removing tannins and iron stains. Apply the brightener according to the manufacturer’s instructions, typically with a pump sprayer. Allow it to sit for the recommended time, then rinse thoroughly with water.

## Deep Cleaning: Tackling Mold and Mildew

If your pressure treated wood has significant mold or mildew growth, you'll need a more powerful cleaning solution. A mixture of bleach and water (1 part bleach to 3 parts water) can be effective, but use it cautiously. Bleach can damage plants and other surfaces, so protect surrounding areas. Apply the solution to the affected areas, let it sit for 10-15 minutes, and then scrub with a brush. Rinse thoroughly with water.

## Protecting Your Investment: Sealing and Staining

Once your pressure treated wood is clean, it's important to protect it from future damage. Applying a sealant or stain will help to repel water, prevent mildew growth, and maintain the wood’s appearance. Choose a product specifically designed for pressure treated wood and follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully.  Consider a water-based sealant for easier application and cleanup.
