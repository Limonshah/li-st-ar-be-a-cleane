## Lawn Mower Won’t Start After Running Out of Gas? Let’s Fix It!

Running out of gas mid-mow is a common frustration. But what happens when you refill the tank and your lawn mower *still* won’t start? It’s a surprisingly frequent problem, and thankfully, often a simple one to solve. This article will walk you through the most common reasons why your lawn mower won’t start after running out of gas and provide quick fixes you can implement right away. We’ll cover everything from priming the engine to checking the spark plug, ensuring you get back to a beautifully manicured lawn as quickly as possible.  Let's get your mower running smoothly again!

**Takeaway:**

*   Prime the engine multiple times after refueling.
*   Check the spark plug for fouling.
*   Inspect the air filter for blockage.
*   Ensure fresh fuel is in the tank.



**Quick Answer:**

If your lawn mower won’t start after running out of gas, it’s usually due to air in the fuel line. Repeatedly priming the engine (10-20 times) often resolves this. If that doesn’t work, check the spark plug and air filter for issues.



## Why Does Running Out of Gas Cause Starting Problems?

When a lawn mower runs out of gas, air enters the fuel line and carburetor. This air pocket prevents the engine from drawing in the new fuel, even after you’ve refilled the tank. Think of it like trying to drink through a straw that’s partially filled with air – it’s much harder to get the liquid flowing.  The engine needs a precise fuel-to-air mixture to ignite, and that air pocket disrupts this balance.  This is especially true for older mowers with carburetors.



## Priming Your Lawn Mower: The First Step

Priming introduces fuel into the carburetor, helping to displace the air and get the engine started.  Most lawn mowers have a primer bulb – a small, clear bubble – located near the carburetor.  Here’s how to prime correctly:

1.  **Locate the Primer Bulb:** Find the bulb and ensure it’s not cracked or damaged.
2.  **Press and Release:** Press the primer bulb firmly several times (10-20 times is common). You should see fuel moving through the bulb.
3.  **Attempt to Start:** After priming, try starting the mower. If it doesn’t start, repeat the priming process.
4.  **Avoid Over-Priming:**  Too much priming can flood the engine, making it even harder to start. If you prime excessively, wait a few minutes before trying again.



## Checking and Cleaning the Spark Plug

A fouled spark plug can prevent the engine from igniting the fuel-air mixture. Running out of gas can sometimes contribute to spark plug fouling. Here’s how to check and clean it:

1.  **Disconnect the Spark Plug Wire:**  Always disconnect the spark plug wire before working on the spark plug to prevent accidental shocks.
2.  **Remove the Spark Plug:** Use a spark plug wrench to carefully remove the spark plug.
3.  **Inspect the Spark Plug:** Look for signs of fouling – black, oily residue or carbon buildup.
4.  **Clean the Spark Plug:** If fouled, clean the spark plug with a wire brush or spark plug cleaner. You can also try gently scraping off the residue.  For a deeper clean, consider using a [spark plug cleaning tool](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-lawn-mower-spark-plug).
5.  **Reinstall and Test:** Reinstall the spark plug, reconnect the wire, and try starting the mower.



## Inspecting and Cleaning the Air Filter

A clogged air filter restricts airflow to the engine, hindering combustion.  While not directly caused by running out of gas, a dirty air filter can exacerbate starting problems.  Here’s how to check and clean it:

1.  **Locate the Air Filter:** The air filter is usually housed in a plastic or metal cover on the engine.
2.  **Remove the Air Filter:**  Remove the cover and carefully take out the air filter.
3.  **Inspect the Air Filter:** Check for dirt, debris, or oil buildup.
4.  **Clean or Replace:** If the filter is slightly dirty, you can gently tap it to remove loose debris. For heavily soiled filters, wash it with mild soap and water (if it’s a washable filter) or replace it entirely.  Keeping your air filter clean is crucial for engine performance, so consider a regular cleaning schedule.  You can find more information on [how to clean a lawn mower air filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-air-filter-on-lawn-mower).
5.  **Reinstall:** Reinstall the clean or new air filter and the cover.



## Dealing with Old or Stale Fuel

If the gas had been sitting in your mower for a while *before* you ran out, it might be stale. Stale gas can cause starting problems and engine damage.  Old fuel degrades and loses its volatility, making it harder to ignite.

1.  **Drain the Fuel Tank:**  Completely drain the old fuel from the tank.
2.  **Flush the Fuel Line:**  Use fresh fuel to flush out the fuel line and carburetor, removing any remaining stale gas.
3.  **Refill with Fresh Fuel:**  Fill the tank with fresh, high-quality gasoline.  Consider using a fuel stabilizer to prevent future fuel degradation.
4.  **Consider a Fuel Tank Cleaner:** For particularly stubborn cases, you might need to use a [gas tank cleaner](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-gas-tank-on-lawn-mower) to thoroughly remove residue.



## Carburetor Issues: A More Complex Fix

If priming, checking the spark plug, and cleaning the air filter don’t work, the carburetor might be the culprit.  A clogged carburetor can prevent fuel from reaching the engine.  This is a more complex repair, and if you’re not comfortable working with small engines, it’s best to take your mower to a professional. However, you can try a quick fix:

1.  **Carburetor Cleaner:** Spray carburetor cleaner into the carburetor’s air intake.
2.  **Let it Sit:** Allow the cleaner to sit for a few minutes to dissolve any buildup.
3.  **Attempt to Start:** Try starting the mower.
4.  **Professional Cleaning:** If this doesn’t work, a professional [carburetor cleaning](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-lawn-mower-carburetor-without-removing) is recommended.



## Fuel Line Inspection

Sometimes, the fuel line itself can be the issue. A cracked or kinked fuel line can restrict fuel flow.

1.  **Visually Inspect:** Carefully examine the fuel line for any visible cracks, kinks, or damage.
2.  **Check for Blockages:** Disconnect the fuel line at both ends and blow through it to ensure it’s clear.
3.  **Replace if Necessary:** If you find any damage or blockages, replace the fuel line.



## FAQ: Lawn Mower Starting Troubles

**Q: How many times should I prime my lawn mower?**
A: Typically, 10-20 times is sufficient.  However, avoid over-priming, as this can flood the engine.

**Q: Can old gas really prevent my mower from starting?**
A: Yes, stale gas loses its volatility and can make it very difficult for the engine to ignite the fuel-air mixture.

**Q: How often should I clean my lawn mower’s air filter?**
A: It depends on how often you mow and the conditions. Generally, cleaning or replacing the air filter every 25-50 hours of use is recommended.

**Q: What if my lawn mower still won’t start after trying these fixes?**
A: If you’ve tried all these steps and your mower still won’t start, it’s best to consult a qualified lawn mower repair technician.



## Conclusion

A lawn mower that won’t start after running out of gas is a common problem, but it’s usually fixable with a few simple steps. Remember to prioritize priming the engine to clear any air from the fuel line, and don’t overlook the importance of a clean spark plug and air filter.  By following these quick fixes, you can get your lawn mower back up and running and enjoy a perfectly manicured lawn.  If you're still having trouble, remember that professional help is always available.  Don't let a stubborn mower ruin your weekend – get back to mowing!
