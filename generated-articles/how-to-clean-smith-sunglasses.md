## Keeping Your Vision Clear: How To Clean Smith Sunglasses

Do you love the clarity and style of your Smith sunglasses? Protecting your investment means knowing how to properly clean them. Dirty lenses can obstruct your view and even scratch the surface over time. This article will walk you through everything you need to know to keep your Smith sunglasses looking and performing their best. We’ll cover everything from daily quick cleans to more thorough cleaning methods, ensuring your vision remains sharp and unobstructed. Let’s dive in and learn how to clean Smith sunglasses effectively!

**Takeaway:**

*   Use a microfiber cloth for daily cleaning.
*   Use lukewarm water and dish soap for deeper cleaning.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive materials.
*   Store your sunglasses properly to prevent scratches.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean Smith sunglasses, gently wipe the lenses with a clean microfiber cloth to remove dust and smudges. For tougher grime, use lukewarm water with a drop of dish soap, rinse thoroughly, and dry with a clean microfiber cloth.

## Why Proper Cleaning Matters for Smith Sunglasses

Smith sunglasses aren’t just a fashion statement; they’re a performance tool. They’re designed with advanced lens technology to protect your eyes and enhance your vision. Proper cleaning is crucial to maintain this performance. Dirt, grime, and even fingerprints can reduce clarity and impact the effectiveness of features like anti-fog coatings. 

Regular cleaning prevents scratches, which can permanently damage the lenses. Scratches scatter light, causing distortion and reducing visual acuity. Think of it like this: you wouldn’t drive a car with a dirty windshield, and you shouldn’t compromise your vision with dirty sunglasses.

## Daily Maintenance: The Microfiber Cloth Method

The easiest and most effective way to keep your Smith sunglasses clean is with a microfiber cloth. Keep one handy – in your car, bag, or even your pocket. This simple step can prevent buildup and maintain clear vision. 

Here’s how to do it:

*   **Gently wipe the lenses:** Use a clean, dry microfiber cloth to gently wipe away dust, fingerprints, and smudges.
*   **Avoid circular motions:** Wipe in a straight line across the lens to avoid creating swirl marks.
*   **Clean the frame:** Use the same cloth to wipe down the frame and nose pads.
*   **Store properly:** When not in use, store your sunglasses in a case to protect them from scratches and dust.

Microfiber cloths are specifically designed for delicate surfaces like lenses. They lift dirt and oil without scratching, unlike paper towels or other abrasive materials.

## Deep Cleaning: Water and Gentle Soap

Sometimes, a microfiber cloth isn’t enough. For stubborn grime or salt spray, you’ll need a more thorough cleaning. Luckily, it’s still simple and safe to do at home.

Here’s how to deep clean your Smith sunglasses:

1.  **Rinse with lukewarm water:** Gently rinse the sunglasses under lukewarm water to remove loose debris.
2.  **Add a drop of dish soap:** Add a tiny drop of mild dish soap to the water. Avoid harsh detergents or abrasive cleaners.
3.  **Gently wash:** Gently wash the lenses and frame with your fingertips.
4.  **Rinse thoroughly:** Rinse the sunglasses thoroughly under lukewarm water to remove all traces of soap.
5.  **Dry with a microfiber cloth:** Dry the lenses and frame with a clean, dry microfiber cloth.

This method effectively removes dirt, oil, and salt without damaging the lenses or frame. If you have other brands of sunglasses, you might find this guide on [how to clean Oakley sunglasses](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-oakley-sunglasses) helpful as well.

## What *Not* To Do When Cleaning Your Smith Sunglasses

Knowing what *not* to do is just as important as knowing what *to* do. Using the wrong cleaning methods can cause irreversible damage to your sunglasses.

*   **Avoid abrasive materials:** Never use paper towels, tissues, or rough cloths to clean your lenses. These can scratch the surface.
*   **Don’t use harsh chemicals:** Avoid cleaners containing alcohol, ammonia, bleach, or other harsh chemicals. These can damage the lens coatings.
*   **Skip the hot water:** Hot water can warp the frame and damage the lens coatings. Always use lukewarm water.
*   **Don’t use saliva:** While it might seem tempting, saliva contains enzymes that can damage the lens coatings.

Following these guidelines will help you avoid costly repairs or replacements.

## Protecting Your Investment: Proper Storage

Cleaning is only half the battle. Proper storage is essential to prevent scratches and damage when your Smith sunglasses aren’t in use. 

*   **Use a protective case:** Always store your sunglasses in a protective case when you’re not wearing them.
*   **Keep the case clean:** Regularly clean the inside of the case to prevent dust and debris from scratching the lenses.
*   **Avoid storing in direct sunlight:** Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can damage the frame and lens coatings.
*   **Store in a cool, dry place:** Avoid storing your sunglasses in humid environments, as this can cause corrosion.

Taking these simple precautions will extend the life of your Smith sunglasses and keep them looking their best. If you also wear Costa sunglasses, you might find this article on [how to clean Costa sunglasses](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-costa-sunglasses) useful.

## Addressing Specific Lens Coatings

Smith sunglasses often feature specialized lens coatings like anti-fog, hydrophobic, or polarized coatings. These coatings require extra care during cleaning.

*   **Polarized lenses:** Use only clean water and a microfiber cloth. Avoid any cleaners that contain alcohol or ammonia, as these can damage the polarization.
*   **Anti-fog coatings:** Be extra gentle when cleaning anti-fog lenses. Avoid rubbing vigorously, as this can wear away the coating.
*   **Hydrophobic coatings:** These coatings repel water and oil. Clean with a microfiber cloth and, if necessary, a mild dish soap solution.

Always check the manufacturer’s instructions for specific cleaning recommendations for your lens coating.
