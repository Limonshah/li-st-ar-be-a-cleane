**What are the most common problems with a Cub Cadet RZT 42?**

The Cub Cadet RZT 42, like any machine, can experience issues. Common problems include hydrostatic transmission failures, PTO clutch malfunctions, engine starting difficulties, and steering problems. Addressing these issues promptly can save you time and money in the long run.

## 1. Hydrostatic Transmission Issues on Your RZT 42

Hydrostatic transmission problems are arguably the most frequently reported issues with the Cub Cadet RZT 42. These problems often manifest as a loss of power, jerky movements, or the mower not moving at all. A failing transmission can significantly impact your mowing experience. 

### Diagnosing Transmission Problems

First, check the hydraulic fluid level. Low fluid is a common culprit. If the fluid is low, top it off with the correct type specified in your owner’s manual.  Also, inspect for leaks around the transmission housing and hydraulic lines. If you notice leaks, they need to be addressed immediately.  Severe transmission issues may require professional diagnosis and repair, or even replacement.

## 2. PTO Clutch Problems: When the Blades Won’t Engage

Another common complaint among Cub Cadet RZT 42 owners is a malfunctioning PTO clutch. This means the blades won’t engage, leaving you with a running engine but no cutting power. This can be incredibly frustrating, especially when you have a large yard to tackle.

### Troubleshooting the PTO Clutch

Start by checking the PTO engagement cable. Ensure it’s properly connected and not damaged.  Next, inspect the PTO clutch itself for signs of wear or damage. A worn clutch may need to be replaced. Sometimes, a simple adjustment of the PTO cable can resolve the issue.

## 3. Engine Starting Problems: A Common Frustration

Difficulty starting the engine is a frequent issue reported by Cub Cadet RZT 42 users. This can range from the engine not turning over at all to it cranking but failing to fire up. Several factors can contribute to this problem.

### Identifying the Cause of Starting Issues

First, check the battery connections to ensure they are clean and tight. A weak or dead battery is a common cause of starting problems.  Next, inspect the spark plug for fouling or damage. A dirty or worn spark plug can prevent the engine from starting.  Also, ensure the fuel tank has fresh gasoline and the fuel line isn’t clogged. If you're still struggling, consider checking the carburetor for issues, as a dirty carburetor can also cause starting problems.

## 4. Steering Problems: Loss of Control

Steering problems can make your Cub Cadet RZT 42 difficult and even dangerous to operate. These issues can manifest as unresponsive steering, jerky movements, or a complete loss of steering control. 

### Investigating Steering Issues

Check the steering linkage for any loose or damaged components. Tighten any loose bolts or replace damaged parts. Inspect the steering wheel itself for any play or wobble.  Also, ensure the lap bars are functioning correctly and are not sticking or binding.  If the problem persists, the steering gearbox may need to be inspected and potentially replaced.

## 5. Fuel System Issues: Fuel Leaks and Carburetor Problems

Fuel system problems can lead to a variety of issues, including difficulty starting, poor performance, and fuel leaks. These problems can be caused by a clogged fuel filter, a faulty fuel pump, or a dirty carburetor.

### Addressing Fuel System Concerns

Start by checking the fuel filter and replacing it if it’s clogged. Inspect the fuel lines for any cracks or leaks. If you find any leaks, replace the damaged fuel lines. A dirty carburetor can also cause fuel system problems. Cleaning the carburetor can often resolve these issues.

## 6. Electrical Problems: Fuses, Solenoids, and Wiring

Electrical problems can manifest in various ways, from a mower that won’t start to intermittent operation of various components. These issues can be caused by blown fuses, faulty solenoids, or damaged wiring.

### Diagnosing Electrical Issues

Start by checking the fuses. Replace any blown fuses with the correct amperage rating. Inspect the wiring for any damage or corrosion. Repair or replace any damaged wiring. A faulty solenoid can also cause electrical problems. Testing the solenoid with a multimeter can help determine if it’s functioning correctly.

## 7. Blade Engagement Issues: Beyond the PTO

Sometimes, the issue isn't the PTO itself, but something preventing the blades from spinning even *when* the PTO is engaged. This could be a broken blade spindle, a damaged blade, or an obstruction under the deck.

### Inspecting Blade Components

Carefully inspect each blade for damage (bends, cracks). Ensure the blades are properly installed and tightened. Check the blade spindles for any signs of wear or damage. Remove any debris that may be obstructing the blades.
