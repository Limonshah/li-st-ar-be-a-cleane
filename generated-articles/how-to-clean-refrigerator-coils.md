## Keeping Cool: How to Clean Refrigerator Coils

Is your refrigerator working harder than it should? You might be surprised to learn that dirty refrigerator coils are often the culprit. Cleaning these coils is a simple task that can significantly improve your refrigerator’s efficiency, saving you money on your energy bill and extending the life of your appliance. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about how to clean refrigerator coils, from locating them to the best cleaning methods. Let’s dive in and get your fridge running at its best!

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly cleaning your refrigerator coils (every 6-12 months) improves efficiency.
*   Dust and debris buildup forces the refrigerator to work harder.
*   Cleaning is a simple DIY task that saves energy and money.

**What are refrigerator coils and why clean them?**

Refrigerator coils are responsible for releasing heat from the refrigerant. They are essentially a series of tubes that transfer heat, allowing your refrigerator to stay cool. Over time, dust, pet hair, and other debris accumulate on these coils, acting as an insulator. This insulation prevents the coils from efficiently releasing heat, causing the refrigerator to work harder to maintain the desired temperature. [https://www.beacleaner.com/how-often-to-clean-condenser-coils](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-often-to-clean-condenser-coils) explains how often you should be doing this.

### Locating Your Refrigerator Coils

Before you can clean your refrigerator coils, you need to find them! The location varies depending on your refrigerator model. Generally, you’ll find them in one of two places: on the back of the refrigerator or underneath it. 

*   **Back-Mounted Coils:** These are common in older refrigerators. You’ll see a grid-like pattern of coils exposed on the back.
*   **Bottom-Mounted Coils:** Many newer refrigerators have coils located underneath the appliance. You’ll likely need to remove a lower access panel to reach them. Always consult your refrigerator’s manual for specific instructions on locating the coils.

### Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Cleaning refrigerator coils doesn’t require a lot of fancy equipment. Here’s what you’ll need:

*   **Screwdriver or Nut Driver:** To remove access panels (if necessary).
*   **Vacuum Cleaner:** With a brush attachment.
*   **Soft Brush:** A long-handled bottle brush or a coil-cleaning brush works well.
*   **Microfiber Cloth:** For wiping down surfaces.
*   **Gloves:** To protect your hands.

Having these supplies ready will make the cleaning process smooth and efficient. Remember safety first, and always unplug your refrigerator before starting any cleaning or maintenance.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Refrigerator Coils

Now that you’ve located your coils and gathered your supplies, let’s get cleaning! Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Unplug the Refrigerator:** This is crucial for safety.
2.  **Locate and Access the Coils:** Remove any access panels as needed.
3.  **Vacuum the Coils:** Use the brush attachment on your vacuum cleaner to gently remove loose dust and debris. Work from top to bottom, being careful not to bend or damage the coils.
4.  **Brush the Coils:** Use a soft brush to loosen any remaining dirt. Vacuum up the loosened debris immediately.
5.  **Wipe Down Surfaces:** Use a damp microfiber cloth to wipe down the surrounding areas.
6.  **Reassemble and Plug In:** Replace any access panels and plug the refrigerator back in.

This process should take about 15-30 minutes, depending on the amount of buildup and the location of your coils. If you have a particularly dirty refrigerator, you may need to repeat the vacuuming and brushing steps.

### Dealing with Stubborn Dirt and Grime

Sometimes, vacuuming and brushing aren’t enough to remove stubborn dirt and grime. In these cases, you can use a specialized coil cleaner. These cleaners are designed to dissolve dirt and grease without damaging the coils. 

*   **Coil Cleaner Application:** Follow the instructions on the coil cleaner carefully. Typically, you’ll spray the cleaner onto the coils and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing with water.
*   **Rinsing:** Ensure all traces of the cleaner are removed to prevent any residue from affecting your food.
*   **Alternative Solution:** A mixture of warm water and mild dish soap can also be used as a gentle cleaning solution.

If you're dealing with a particularly challenging buildup, consider consulting a professional appliance repair technician.

### Cleaning Different Types of Refrigerator Coils

While the general cleaning process is the same, there are some differences to consider depending on the type of coils your refrigerator has.

*   **Aluminum Coils:** These are the most common type of coils. They are relatively easy to clean with the methods described above.
*   **Copper Coils:** Copper coils are more durable but can be more susceptible to corrosion. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or brushes on copper coils.
*   **Microchannel Coils:** These coils have a very dense fin structure and require special cleaning techniques. Using a standard brush can easily damage the fins. A specialized microchannel coil cleaner and a low-pressure sprayer are recommended.

### Preventing Future Buildup

Cleaning your refrigerator coils is important, but preventing buildup in the first place is even better. Here are a few tips:

*   **Regular Vacuuming:** Vacuum the area around your refrigerator regularly to remove dust and pet hair.
*   **Air Filter Replacement:** If your refrigerator has an air filter, replace it according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
*   **Proper Ventilation:** Ensure your refrigerator has adequate ventilation space around it.
*   **Pet Hair Control:** If you have pets, try to keep them away from the refrigerator to minimize hair buildup.

By following these tips, you can significantly reduce the amount of dust and debris that accumulates on your refrigerator coils.



### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How often should I clean my refrigerator coils?**
A: It’s generally recommended to clean your refrigerator coils every 6-12 months. However, if you have pets or live in a dusty environment, you may need to clean them more frequently.

**Q: Will cleaning the coils really save me money?**
A: Yes! Dirty coils force your refrigerator to work harder, consuming more energy. Cleaning them can reduce your energy bill by up to 10-25%.

**Q: Is it safe to clean the coils myself?**
A: Yes, it’s generally safe to clean the coils yourself, as long as you unplug the refrigerator first and follow the instructions carefully.

**Q: What if I bend the coils during cleaning?**
A: Bent coils can restrict airflow and reduce efficiency. Use a fin comb to gently straighten any bent fins.

**Q: Can I use a pressure washer to clean the coils?**
A: No, do not use a pressure washer. The high pressure can damage the delicate coils.
