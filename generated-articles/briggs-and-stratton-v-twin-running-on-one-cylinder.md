## Briggs And Stratton V Twin Running On One Cylinder: A Troubleshooting Guide

Have you noticed your Briggs & Stratton V Twin engine sputtering and lacking power? It’s a frustrating problem, but often solvable. A common symptom is the engine running on only one cylinder, significantly reducing performance. This guide will walk you through the likely causes, diagnostic steps, and potential fixes to get your engine running smoothly again. We’ll cover everything from simple checks to more involved repairs, helping you restore full power to your lawnmower or other equipment.

**Takeaway:**

*   Check the spark plug on the non-firing cylinder.
*   Inspect the fuel line and carburetor for blockages.
*   Perform a compression test to assess cylinder health.
*   Consider valve issues if compression is low.

**Quick Answer:** A Briggs & Stratton V Twin running on one cylinder usually indicates a problem with the spark, fuel, or compression on the affected cylinder. Identifying which system is failing is key to a successful repair.



## 1. Understanding Why a V Twin Might Run on One Cylinder

A V Twin engine, as the name suggests, has two cylinders arranged in a "V" shape.  Each cylinder contributes to the engine's power output. When one cylinder isn't firing, the engine loses approximately 50% of its potential power. This results in rough idling, reduced cutting performance (in lawnmowers), and overall sluggish operation. Several factors can cause this, and it’s important to systematically investigate each possibility.  Don't assume the worst – often, it's a simple fix!

## 2. Spark Issues: The First Place to Look

The spark plug ignites the air-fuel mixture in the cylinder. If a spark plug is fouled, damaged, or has a bad connection, that cylinder won't fire. This is the most common reason for a Briggs & Stratton V Twin running on one cylinder.  Let's break down how to check this:

*   **Visual Inspection:** Remove the spark plug from the non-firing cylinder. Look for signs of fouling (carbon buildup), cracks in the porcelain, or a worn electrode.
*   **Spark Test:**  Reconnect the spark plug wire to the plug. Ground the plug body against the engine block. Pull the starter rope. You should see a strong, blue spark. If the spark is weak, orange, or nonexistent, the plug is likely the problem.
*   **Spark Plug Wire:** Inspect the spark plug wire for damage or loose connections. A damaged wire can prevent the spark from reaching the plug.
*   **Ignition Module:** While less common, a failing ignition module can cause intermittent spark issues.



## 3. Fuel Delivery Problems: Ensuring Both Cylinders Get Gas

If the spark is good, the next step is to investigate fuel delivery. A blockage in the fuel line, carburetor, or fuel filter can starve a cylinder of fuel.  This is especially common if the machine has been sitting for a while. Here’s how to check:

*   **Fuel Line:** Disconnect the fuel line to the affected cylinder's carburetor.  Ensure fuel flows freely. If not, trace the line back to the fuel tank, checking for kinks or obstructions.
*   **Carburetor:** A clogged carburetor is a frequent culprit.  The small jets within the carburetor can become blocked with varnish or debris.  You may need to disassemble and clean the carburetor.  Consider checking out a guide on [how to clean a Briggs and Stratton carburetor](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-briggs-and-stratton-carburetor) for detailed instructions.
*   **Fuel Filter:** Replace the fuel filter. A clogged filter restricts fuel flow to the engine.



## 4. Compression Testing: Assessing Cylinder Health

Compression is essential for proper combustion. Low compression in a cylinder means the air-fuel mixture isn't being adequately compressed, preventing ignition. A compression test will reveal if a cylinder has a mechanical problem.

*   **Performing the Test:** Remove the spark plug from the cylinder you're testing. Screw in a compression tester into the spark plug hole. Pull the starter rope several times and record the highest reading.
*   **Interpreting Results:** A healthy Briggs & Stratton V Twin cylinder should have a compression reading of at least 90 PSI. Readings significantly lower than this indicate a problem.
*   **Wet Test:** If compression is low, repeat the test with a small amount of oil added to the cylinder. If the compression increases, it suggests worn piston rings are the issue.



## 5. Valve Issues: A More Involved Repair

If compression is low and the wet test doesn't improve it, the problem likely lies with the valves. Valves control the flow of air and fuel into and exhaust out of the cylinder.

*   **Stuck Valves:** A valve can become stuck open or closed due to carbon buildup or corrosion.
*   **Worn Valve Seats:** Over time, the valve seats can wear, preventing a proper seal.
*   **Valve Springs:** A broken or weak valve spring can prevent the valve from closing completely.
*   **Valve Adjustment:** Incorrect valve lash (the gap between the valve stem and rocker arm) can also cause problems.  You may need to adjust the valve lash according to the engine's specifications.  If you're not comfortable working with valves, it's best to consult a qualified mechanic.

## 6. Checking the Overhead Valve (OHV) System

Briggs & Stratton V Twin engines typically use an Overhead Valve (OHV) system. This system relies on pushrods and rocker arms to actuate the valves.  Problems within this system can prevent a cylinder from firing.

*   **Pushrod Inspection:** Check the pushrods for bends or damage. A bent pushrod won't properly actuate the valve.
*   **Rocker Arm Inspection:** Inspect the rocker arms for wear or damage. Ensure they move freely.
*   **Rocker Arm Studs:** Check the rocker arm studs for looseness. Loose studs can cause valve timing issues.



## 7.  Additional Considerations and Preventative Maintenance

Beyond the main culprits, a few other things can contribute to a V Twin running on one cylinder.

*   **Blocked Exhaust:** A blocked exhaust port can create backpressure, hindering cylinder performance.
*   **Incorrect Timing:** While less common, incorrect engine timing can cause misfires.
*   **Regular Maintenance:** Preventative maintenance is key. Regularly change the oil, air filter, and spark plugs.  Clean the carburetor annually, especially if the engine is used infrequently.



## FAQ

**Q: Can dirty air filter cause a Briggs & Stratton V Twin to run on one cylinder?**
A: While a severely clogged air filter can cause overall poor performance, it's unlikely to cause the engine to run *only* on one cylinder. However, it can exacerbate other issues, so it's always a good idea to check and clean or replace it.

**Q: How often should I change the spark plugs on my Briggs & Stratton V Twin?**
A: Generally, spark plugs should be replaced every 100 hours of operation or annually, whichever comes first.

**Q: What does it mean if I get spark on both plugs, but the engine still runs on one cylinder?**
A: This suggests the problem isn't the spark itself, but rather a fuel or compression issue on the non-firing cylinder. Focus your troubleshooting on those areas.

**Q: Is it worth rebuilding a Briggs & Stratton V Twin engine?**
A: It depends on the extent of the damage and the cost of parts. If the damage is limited to a few components, a rebuild can be cost-effective. However, if the engine has significant wear, it may be more economical to replace it.




In conclusion, diagnosing a Briggs & Stratton V Twin running on one cylinder requires a systematic approach. Start with the simple checks – spark plugs and fuel delivery – and then move on to more involved tests like compression testing and valve inspection.  By following these steps, you can pinpoint the problem and get your engine running at its full potential. Remember to prioritize safety and consult a qualified mechanic if you're uncomfortable performing any of these repairs.
