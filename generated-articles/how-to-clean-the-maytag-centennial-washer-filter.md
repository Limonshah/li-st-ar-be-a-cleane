Is your Maytag Centennial washer not draining properly, or are you noticing a musty smell? A clogged filter is often the culprit. Don't worry, cleaning the filter on your Maytag Centennial washer is a simple DIY task that can save you from costly repairs and keep your laundry smelling fresh. This guide will walk you through the entire process, step-by-step, ensuring your washer continues to deliver clean clothes for years to come. We’ll cover everything from locating the filter to cleaning it and getting it back in place.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly cleaning your Maytag Centennial washer filter (every 6 months is a good rule of thumb) prevents clogs.
*   A clean filter ensures proper drainage and optimal washing performance.
*   This is a simple DIY task that can save you money on repair bills.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean the Maytag Centennial washer filter, locate it behind the kickplate at the bottom front of the machine, drain any remaining water, carefully unscrew and remove the filter, clean away lint and debris, and reinstall it securely.

## Understanding the Importance of a Clean Washer Filter

Your Maytag Centennial washer filter is designed to catch lint, hair, coins, and other small objects that can escape during the wash cycle. Over time, these items accumulate, restricting water flow and potentially causing drainage issues. A clogged filter can lead to longer wash cycles, reduced cleaning effectiveness, and even damage to your washer’s pump. Regularly cleaning this filter is a crucial part of maintaining your appliance and ensuring it operates efficiently. Think of it as a small task with a big impact on the lifespan of your washing machine.

## Locating the Maytag Centennial Washer Filter

Finding the filter is the first step. On the Maytag Centennial washer, the filter is conveniently located behind a small access panel, often referred to as the kickplate, at the bottom front of the machine. To access it, you’ll need a flathead screwdriver. Carefully remove the screws securing the kickplate. Once the kickplate is removed, you’ll see the filter cover. This cover is usually a round or rectangular cap that you can unscrew or twist to remove.  If you're unsure, consult your washer's owner's manual for specific instructions.  For other Maytag models, you might find similar filter access points, but always refer to the manual.

## Preparing to Remove the Filter: Draining Remaining Water

Before you remove the filter, it’s essential to drain any remaining water from the washer.  Most Maytag Centennial models have a small drain hose located near the filter. Place a shallow pan or towel underneath the drain hose to catch the water. Carefully pull out the drain hose and allow the water to drain completely. This prevents a messy spill when you remove the filter.  Be patient, as it may take a few minutes for all the water to drain.  Once drained, you're ready to proceed to the next step.

## Removing and Cleaning the Filter

Now for the main event! Once the water is drained, carefully unscrew or twist the filter cover. Be prepared for a little more water to trickle out, even after draining the hose. Gently pull the filter straight out. You’ll likely find a collection of lint, hair, coins, and other debris.  Remove all visible debris by hand. For stubborn buildup, you can rinse the filter under warm running water. A soft brush, like an old toothbrush, can help dislodge any remaining particles. Ensure the filter is completely clean before reinstalling it.  Don't use harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these could damage the filter.

## Reinstalling the Filter and Kickplate

With the filter thoroughly cleaned, it’s time to reinstall it. Carefully insert the filter back into its housing, ensuring it’s seated correctly. Screw or twist the filter cover back on tightly, but don’t overtighten it.  Replace the kickplate, securing it with the screws you removed earlier. Double-check that all screws are firmly in place. Finally, run a quick rinse cycle to ensure the filter is properly sealed and there are no leaks. This simple step confirms everything is working as it should.

Cleaning your Maytag Centennial washer filter is important, but preventing clogs is even better. Here are a few tips to help keep your filter clean:

*   **Empty pockets:** Always check pockets before loading clothes into the washer.
*   **Use laundry bags:** Use mesh laundry bags for delicate items like socks and lingerie.
