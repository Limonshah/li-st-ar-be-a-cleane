## Craftsman M220 Lawn Mower Won't Start: A Troubleshooting Guide

Is your weekend mowing plan stalled because your Craftsman M220 lawn mower won’t start? It’s a frustrating situation, but often a simple fix is all it takes. This article will walk you through the most common reasons why your mower is refusing to cooperate and provide clear, step-by-step instructions to get it running again. We’ll cover everything from basic checks to more involved troubleshooting, ensuring you can tackle this issue with confidence. Let's get your yard looking great again!

**Takeaway:**

*   Check the fuel system for old gas or clogs.
*   Inspect the spark plug for fouling or damage.
*   Ensure the safety features are functioning correctly.
*   Verify the air filter is clean and unobstructed.

**Quick Answer:**

A Craftsman M220 that won’t start usually stems from fuel issues, a faulty spark plug, or a safety switch problem. Checking these areas first will often resolve the issue and get your mower running smoothly.

## 1. Fuel System Issues: The Most Common Culprit

Often, a Craftsman M220 lawn mower won't start because of problems within the fuel system. Old or stale gasoline is a frequent offender, especially if the mower has been sitting for a while. Gasoline degrades over time, losing its volatility and making it difficult for the engine to ignite.  Start by draining the old fuel from the tank and replacing it with fresh gasoline. You can also add a fuel stabilizer to help prevent future degradation. 

Another common issue is a clogged fuel filter or carburetor. A clogged fuel filter restricts the flow of fuel to the engine, while a clogged carburetor prevents proper fuel-air mixture.  Consider replacing the fuel filter – they are inexpensive and easy to change. If you suspect a carburetor issue, you might need to clean it.

## 2. Spark Plug Problems: No Spark, No Start

If the fuel system seems fine, the next area to investigate is the spark plug. The spark plug is responsible for igniting the air-fuel mixture in the engine. A fouled, damaged, or improperly gapped spark plug can prevent the engine from starting.  Remove the spark plug and visually inspect it. Look for signs of carbon buildup, cracking, or corrosion. 

If the spark plug looks questionable, replace it with a new one of the correct type for your Craftsman M220.  You can also test the spark plug using a spark tester to see if it's producing a strong spark.  Properly gapping the spark plug is also crucial for optimal performance.

## 3. Safety Switch Malfunctions: Protecting You and Your Mower

Craftsman M220 lawn mowers are equipped with several safety switches designed to prevent accidental starting. These switches include the blade engagement switch, the operator presence switch (on riding mowers), and the bail handle switch. If any of these switches are faulty or not fully engaged, the mower won't start. 

Carefully check each safety switch to ensure it's functioning correctly. Make sure the blade engagement lever is fully disengaged before attempting to start the mower.  On riding mowers, ensure you are seated and the operator presence switch is activated.  If a switch appears to be faulty, it may need to be replaced.

## 4. Air Filter Inspection: Breathing Easy for Your Engine

A dirty or clogged air filter restricts airflow to the engine, which can cause starting problems and reduced performance. The air filter prevents dust and debris from entering the engine, so it's important to keep it clean.  Remove the air filter and inspect it for dirt, debris, or damage. 

If the air filter is paper, gently tap it to remove loose dirt. If it's foam, wash it with mild soap and water, then allow it to dry completely before reinstalling. If the air filter is heavily soiled or damaged, replace it with a new one.  Regular air filter maintenance is key to keeping your mower running smoothly.

## 5. Checking the Battery and Starter System

While less common on push mowers, if your Craftsman M220 has an electric start, a weak or dead battery can prevent it from starting. Check the battery voltage with a multimeter. A fully charged 12-volt battery should read around 12.6 volts. If the voltage is low, try charging the battery. 

If the battery is fully charged but the mower still won't start, the starter solenoid or starter motor may be faulty. These components are responsible for cranking the engine.  Testing these components requires some electrical knowledge, so if you're not comfortable doing it yourself, it's best to take the mower to a qualified repair technician.

## 6. Dealing with a Flooded Engine

Sometimes, repeated attempts to start the mower can lead to a flooded engine. This happens when too much fuel accumulates in the cylinder, making it difficult for the spark plug to ignite the mixture. If you suspect a flooded engine, remove the spark plug and pull the starter cord several times to clear out the excess fuel. 

Allow the cylinder to air out for a few minutes before reinstalling the spark plug and attempting to start the mower again. Avoid using the choke when starting a flooded engine, as this will only add more fuel to the cylinder.

## 7. Winter Storage Issues and Starting Problems

If your Craftsman M220 has been sitting unused for an extended period, especially over the winter, it may be difficult to start.  Old fuel, a discharged battery, and corrosion can all contribute to starting problems. Before attempting to start the mower after winter storage, drain the old fuel, charge the battery, and inspect all components for corrosion.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Why won't my Craftsman M220 start even after replacing the spark plug?**
A: Replacing the spark plug is a good start, but other issues could be at play. Check the fuel system for old gas or clogs, ensure the safety switches are functioning correctly, and verify the air filter is clean. A weak spark from the ignition coil could also be the problem.

**Q: What does it mean if my Craftsman M220 cranks but won't start?**
A: If the engine cranks but doesn't start, it usually indicates a problem with the fuel system or ignition system. Check for fuel delivery, spark, and compression. A clogged carburetor or a faulty ignition coil are common culprits.

**Q: How often should I replace the fuel filter on my Craftsman M220?**
A: It's generally recommended to replace the fuel filter every 25-50 hours of operation, or at least once a year. This helps ensure a consistent flow of fuel to the engine.

**Q: Can I use fuel stabilizer in my Craftsman M220?**
A: Yes, using fuel stabilizer is highly recommended, especially if you plan to store the mower for an extended period. It helps prevent fuel degradation and keeps the fuel system clean.
