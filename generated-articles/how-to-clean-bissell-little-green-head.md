## Keeping Your Bissell Little Green Head Clean: A Simple Guide

Is your Bissell Little Green not performing as well as it used to? Often, the culprit isn’t the machine itself, but a dirty cleaning head. A clean head ensures effective stain removal and prevents the spread of bacteria. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to thoroughly clean your Bissell Little Green head, restoring its cleaning power and extending its lifespan. We’ll cover everything from quick rinses to deep cleaning procedures, ensuring your Little Green stays in top shape.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly rinse the head after each use.
*   Deep clean the head weekly or bi-weekly, depending on usage.
*   Disassemble the head for a more thorough cleaning.
*   Use mild soap and water for cleaning.
*   Ensure all parts are completely dry before reassembling.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean your Bissell Little Green head, remove it from the machine, rinse it under warm water, and scrub with a mild soap solution. Pay attention to the spray nozzle and brush bristles. Rinse thoroughly and allow to air dry completely before reattaching.

## Why Cleaning Your Little Green Head Matters

Let's face it, the Bissell Little Green tackles some seriously messy situations. From pet accidents to spilled drinks, it sees it all. Over time, this leads to a buildup of dirt, grime, and bacteria on the cleaning head. A dirty head reduces suction power, making it harder to lift stains. It can also harbor unpleasant odors and potentially spread germs around your home. Regularly cleaning the head ensures optimal performance and a hygienic cleaning experience.

## Daily Maintenance: A Quick Rinse

After each use of your Bissell Little Green, a quick rinse is essential. This prevents buildup and keeps things fresh. Simply detach the cleaning head from the machine – it usually clicks off easily. Run the head under warm water, focusing on the spray nozzle and brush bristles. Gently work the water through the nozzle to dislodge any lingering debris. This simple step takes less than a minute and significantly extends the life of your cleaning head.

## Deep Cleaning Your Bissell Little Green Head

For a more thorough clean, you’ll want to deep clean your Little Green head weekly or bi-weekly, depending on how often you use it. Start by detaching the head and rinsing it as described above. Next, prepare a solution of warm water and a mild dish soap. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the plastic components.

*   Submerge the head in the soapy water and let it soak for 5-10 minutes.
*   Use a soft brush (an old toothbrush works well) to scrub the spray nozzle, bristles, and any other hard-to-reach areas.
*   Rinse thoroughly under warm water until all soap residue is gone.

## Disassembling the Head for a Thorough Clean

For the deepest clean possible, you can disassemble the Bissell Little Green head. This allows you to access and clean all the individual components. Consult your Bissell Little Green owner’s manual for specific disassembly instructions, as models may vary slightly. Generally, you’ll be able to remove the brush roll and any other detachable parts. 

Once disassembled, wash each component separately in warm, soapy water. Pay close attention to the brush roll, removing any tangled hair or fibers. Ensure all parts are completely rinsed and free of soap residue before reassembling. If you're dealing with a particularly stubborn buildup, consider using a small tool to gently scrape away the debris.

## Cleaning the Spray Nozzle: Preventing Clogs

The spray nozzle is a common area for clogs to form. Mineral deposits from hard water or dried cleaning solution can obstruct the nozzle, reducing spray pressure. To clean the nozzle, use a small pin or needle to gently poke through the opening and dislodge any blockages. You can also soak the nozzle in white vinegar for 30 minutes to dissolve mineral deposits.

## Drying and Reassembly: Avoiding Mold and Mildew

Proper drying is crucial to prevent mold and mildew growth. After cleaning, shake off any excess water and allow all components to air dry completely. You can place the parts on a clean towel or drying rack. Avoid using a hairdryer or other heat source, as this can damage the plastic. Once everything is completely dry, carefully reassemble the head according to your owner’s manual. Ensuring everything is dry prevents unpleasant odors and maintains the hygiene of your cleaning tool.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Sometimes, even after cleaning, you might encounter issues with your Bissell Little Green head. Here are a few common problems and solutions:

*   **Reduced Suction:** Check for clogs in the spray nozzle or hose. Ensure the dirty water tank is empty.
*   **Unpleasant Odor:** Deep clean the head and consider using a cleaning solution specifically designed to eliminate odors.
*   **Brush Roll Not Spinning:** Check for tangled hair or fibers wrapped around the brush roll. Ensure the brush roll is properly seated.
*   **Spray Nozzle Clogged:** Follow the cleaning instructions for the spray nozzle outlined above.
