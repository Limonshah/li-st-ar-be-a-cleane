## Keeping Your Clothes Clean Starts With a Clean Filter: How To Clean The Maytag Bravos Xl Washer Filter

Is your Maytag Bravos XL washer not draining properly, or are your clothes still dirty after a wash? A clogged filter is often the culprit. Don't worry, cleaning it is a simple task that can save you from costly repairs and ensure your laundry comes out perfectly every time. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about cleaning the filter in your Maytag Bravos XL washer, from locating it to performing the cleaning process. We’ll also cover why regular filter cleaning is so important for the longevity of your appliance. Let's get started!

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly cleaning your Maytag Bravos XL washer filter (every 6 months) prevents clogs.
*   A clean filter improves washing performance and prevents damage to your machine.
*   The filter is located inside the washer, accessible from the front.
*   Cleaning requires minimal tools and takes less than 30 minutes.

A clean washer filter is essential for optimal performance. It prevents lint, hair, and small objects from clogging the drain pump. 

## Why Cleaning Your Maytag Bravos XL Filter Matters

Your Maytag Bravos XL washer relies on a filter to trap debris before it reaches the drain pump. Over time, this filter can become clogged with lint, hair, coins, buttons, and other small items. A clogged filter restricts water flow, leading to several problems. These include longer wash cycles, reduced cleaning effectiveness, and even potential damage to the drain pump. Regularly cleaning the filter prevents these issues and extends the life of your washing machine.

## Locating the Filter on Your Maytag Bravos XL Washer

Finding the filter is the first step. The filter on the Maytag Bravos XL is located behind an access panel on the front of the washer, near the bottom. You'll need to carefully remove this panel to access the filter housing. 

Here’s how to locate it:

1.  **Locate the Access Panel:** Look for a small rectangular panel at the bottom front of your washer.
2.  **Remove the Panel:** Gently pry the panel open. You might need a flathead screwdriver, but be careful not to scratch the washer's finish.
3.  **Find the Filter Cap:** Behind the panel, you'll see a round cap. This is the filter housing.

## Tools You’ll Need to Clean the Filter

Fortunately, you don’t need a lot of fancy tools to clean your Maytag Bravos XL washer filter. Here’s a simple list of what you’ll need:

*   **Flathead Screwdriver:** For removing the access panel (optional, sometimes it pops off easily).
*   **Towels:** To absorb any spilled water.
*   **Bucket or Basin:** To catch water when removing the filter.
*   **Old Toothbrush or Small Brush:** For scrubbing the filter.
*   **Gloves (Optional):** To keep your hands clean.

2.  **Open the Filter Cap:** Slowly unscrew the filter cap. It may be tight, so apply steady pressure. Be prepared for water to drain out.
3.  **Remove the Filter:** Once the cap is off, carefully pull out the filter. It might be full of debris.
4.  **Clean the Filter:** Rinse the filter under running water to remove loose debris. Use an old toothbrush or small brush to scrub away any stubborn lint or buildup.
5.  **Inspect the Filter Housing:** While the filter is removed, shine a flashlight into the filter housing and check for any remaining debris. Remove anything you find.
6.  **Reinstall the Filter:** Insert the cleaned filter back into the housing, ensuring it’s properly seated.
7.  **Secure the Filter Cap:** Screw the filter cap back on tightly.
8.  **Replace the Access Panel:** Snap the access panel back into place.

## Preventing Future Clogs and Maintaining Your Washer

Cleaning the filter is a great start, but you can also take steps to prevent future clogs and keep your Maytag Bravos XL washer in top condition. Consider these tips:

*   **Empty Pockets:** Always check pockets before loading clothes into the washer.
*   **Use Laundry Bags:** Use mesh laundry bags for delicate items like socks and lingerie.
*   **Avoid Overloading:** Don’t overload the washer, as this can prevent proper rinsing and increase the amount of lint.
*   **Regular Cleaning:** Clean the filter at least every six months, or more often if you wash a lot of heavily soiled items.
*   **Use HE Detergent:** Always use High Efficiency (HE) detergent, as regular detergent can create excessive suds and contribute to clogs. You can also learn more about keeping your washer fresh by reading about [how to clean a smelly washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-smelly-washer).
