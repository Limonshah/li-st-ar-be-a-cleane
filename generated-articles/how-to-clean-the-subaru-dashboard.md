## Subaru Dashboard Cleaning: A Step-by-Step Guide

Is your Subaru dashboard looking a little dusty or grimy? A clean dashboard not only improves the appearance of your vehicle but also contributes to a more pleasant driving experience. This guide will walk you through how to effectively clean your Subaru dashboard, keeping it looking its best for years to come. We’ll cover everything from gathering supplies to protecting the surface after cleaning.

**Takeaway:**

*   Use a microfiber cloth and gentle cleaner.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals that can damage the dashboard.
*   Protect the dashboard with a UV protectant.
*   Regular cleaning prevents buildup and makes the process easier.

**Quick Answer:** To clean your Subaru dashboard, vacuum loose debris, then gently wipe with a microfiber cloth dampened with a mild all-purpose cleaner or a dedicated interior detailer. Follow up with a dashboard protectant to prevent cracking and fading.

## 1. Gathering Your Subaru Dashboard Cleaning Supplies

Before you begin, having the right tools makes the job much easier. You don’t need a lot, but choosing the correct items is important to avoid damaging your Subaru’s interior. Start by collecting these essentials: a vacuum with a brush attachment, microfiber cloths (several!), a mild all-purpose cleaner or a dedicated interior detailer, a soft-bristled brush, and a dashboard protectant with UV protection. Avoid using harsh chemicals like bleach or ammonia, as these can discolor or damage the dashboard material. For stubborn stains, consider a specialized automotive stain remover, but always test it in an inconspicuous area first.

## 2. Preparing Your Subaru Dashboard for Cleaning

First, remove any personal items from the dashboard. This includes phone mounts, air fresheners, and anything else that might be sitting on the surface. Next, use the vacuum with the brush attachment to remove loose dirt, dust, and debris. Pay attention to vents, crevices, and around buttons and knobs. A vacuum is your first line of defense against grime, and it prevents you from simply spreading dirt around when you start wiping. This step is crucial for a thorough clean and will make the subsequent steps much more effective.

## 3. Choosing the Right Cleaner for Your Subaru’s Dashboard

Subaru dashboards are often made of various materials, including plastic, vinyl, and sometimes even wood trim. Selecting the right cleaner is vital to avoid damage. A mild all-purpose cleaner diluted with water is a good starting point for most surfaces. However, for more delicate materials or specific stains, a dedicated interior detailer is recommended. If you have [Subaru Startex](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-subaru-startex) material, be sure to check the manufacturer’s recommendations for cleaning products. Always test the cleaner in an inconspicuous area before applying it to the entire dashboard.

## 4. Cleaning the Dashboard Surface: A Gentle Approach

Dampen a clean microfiber cloth with your chosen cleaner – don’t saturate it! You want the cloth to be damp, not dripping. Gently wipe the dashboard surface in a circular motion, paying attention to areas with visible dirt or grime. For textured surfaces, use a soft-bristled brush to gently agitate the cleaner and loosen stubborn debris. Avoid applying excessive pressure, as this could scratch the surface. Remember to clean around buttons, knobs, and vents, using a cotton swab for hard-to-reach areas.

## 5. Dealing with Stubborn Stains on Your Subaru Dashboard

Sometimes, a simple wipe-down isn’t enough to remove stubborn stains. For these situations, try a specialized automotive stain remover, but *always* test it in an inconspicuous area first. Apply a small amount of the stain remover to a clean microfiber cloth and gently blot the stain – don’t rub! Allow the stain remover to sit for a few minutes, then wipe away with a clean, damp cloth. If the stain persists, repeat the process, but avoid using excessive amounts of the product. You might also find success with a paste made from baking soda and water for certain types of stains.

## 6. Protecting Your Subaru Dashboard from UV Damage

Once the dashboard is clean and dry, it’s time to protect it from the damaging effects of the sun. UV rays can cause the dashboard to fade, crack, and become brittle over time. Apply a dashboard protectant with UV protection, following the product’s instructions. Spray the protectant onto a clean microfiber cloth and wipe it evenly over the dashboard surface. Avoid applying the protectant directly to the dashboard, as this can cause streaking. A good protectant will leave a matte finish and help keep your dashboard looking new for years to come. Maintaining your car's interior is just as important as the exterior, so consider cleaning your [Subaru cloth seats](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-subaru-cloth-seats) as well.

## 7. Maintaining a Clean Subaru Dashboard: Regular Care

Regular cleaning is the key to maintaining a pristine Subaru dashboard. Make it a habit to wipe down the dashboard with a damp microfiber cloth at least once a week. This will prevent dirt and dust from building up and make more thorough cleaning sessions less frequent. Also, consider using a dashboard cover when parking your Subaru in direct sunlight for extended periods. This will provide an extra layer of protection against UV damage.
