## Keeping Your Little Green Sparkling: How To Clean The Bissell Little Green Brush Head

Is your Bissell Little Green losing its cleaning power? Often, the culprit isn’t the machine itself, but a dirty brush head. A clogged or grime-covered brush head can’t effectively scrub away stains, leaving you with less-than-perfect results. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to thoroughly clean your Bissell Little Green brush head, restoring its cleaning ability and extending its lifespan. We’ll cover everything from quick rinses to deep cleaning methods, ensuring your Little Green continues to tackle messes with ease.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly remove hair and debris from the brush head.
*   Rinse the brush head after each use to prevent buildup.
*   Deep clean the brush head monthly with a mild cleaning solution.
*   Allow the brush head to dry completely before reattaching.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean your Bissell Little Green brush head, remove it from the machine, rinse away loose debris, and scrub with warm, soapy water. Rinse thoroughly and allow to air dry completely before reattaching.

## Why Cleaning Your Brush Head Matters

You might be surprised how quickly the brush head on your Bissell Little Green can accumulate dirt, grime, and even pet hair. This buildup significantly reduces its effectiveness, meaning you’ll need to go over stains multiple times, or even find it impossible to remove them at all. A clean brush head ensures optimal contact with surfaces, maximizing scrubbing power and delivering the best possible cleaning results. Plus, regular cleaning prevents the growth of mold and bacteria, keeping your cleaning solution fresh and your home hygienic.

## Simple Daily Maintenance: Rinsing After Each Use

The easiest way to keep your Bissell Little Green brush head clean is to rinse it after *every* use. This prevents dirt and cleaning solution from drying and hardening on the bristles. Simply detach the brush head from the machine – it usually clicks off easily. Then, hold it under warm running water, using your fingers to gently remove any visible debris.  Avoid using extremely hot water, as this could potentially damage the bristles. This quick step takes less than a minute and makes a huge difference in maintaining performance.

## Deep Cleaning Your Brush Head: A Step-by-Step Guide

While rinsing is great for daily maintenance, a deep clean is necessary to remove stubborn grime and buildup. Here’s how to do it:

1.  **Detach the Brush Head:** As before, carefully remove the brush head from your Bissell Little Green.
2.  **Prepare a Cleaning Solution:** Mix a small amount of mild dish soap with warm water in a sink or basin. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the bristles.
3.  **Soak and Scrub:** Submerge the brush head in the soapy water and let it soak for 5-10 minutes. This helps to loosen stubborn dirt. Then, use a soft-bristled brush (an old toothbrush works well!) to scrub the bristles thoroughly, paying attention to the base where dirt tends to accumulate.
4.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse the brush head under warm running water until all traces of soap are gone.  Ensure no soapy residue remains, as this could affect the performance of your Little Green.
5.  **Disinfect (Optional):** For extra hygiene, you can lightly spray the brush head with a disinfectant spray after rinsing.
6.  **Dry Completely:** This is crucial! Allow the brush head to air dry completely before reattaching it to the machine.  Moisture can lead to mold growth.

## Tackling Stubborn Debris and Hair

Sometimes, rinsing and scrubbing aren’t enough to remove stubborn debris, especially pet hair. Here are a few tricks:

*   **Tweezers or Needle-Nose Pliers:** Use tweezers or needle-nose pliers to carefully pull out tangled hair or fibers.
*   **Compressed Air:** A can of compressed air can blast away loose debris from hard-to-reach areas.
*   **Vinegar Soak:** For particularly stubborn buildup, soak the brush head in a solution of equal parts white vinegar and water for 30 minutes before scrubbing.  Vinegar helps to dissolve mineral deposits and grime.

*   **Baking Soda Paste:** Create a paste of baking soda and water and apply it to stubborn stains. Let it sit for a few minutes before scrubbing.

## Preventing Future Buildup: Best Practices

Preventing buildup is always easier than cleaning it up! Here are some tips to keep your Bissell Little Green brush head cleaner for longer:

*   **Pre-Treat Stains:** Before using your Little Green, pre-treat heavily soiled areas with a stain remover. This reduces the amount of dirt the brush head needs to tackle.
*   **Empty and Clean the Tanks Regularly:** A clean machine performs better. Regularly empty and clean both the clean and dirty water tanks.
*   **Use Filtered Water:** Using filtered water in your Little Green can help prevent mineral buildup on the brush head.
*   **Store Properly:** Store your Little Green and its accessories in a clean, dry place.

## When to Replace Your Brush Head

Even with regular cleaning, the brush head will eventually wear out. If you notice any of the following, it’s time to replace it:

*   **Bent or Damaged Bristles:** Bent or broken bristles won’t effectively scrub surfaces.
*   **Persistent Odor:** If the brush head retains an unpleasant odor even after cleaning, it’s likely harboring bacteria.
*   **Reduced Cleaning Performance:** If you’re consistently getting poor cleaning results despite a clean brush head and machine, it’s time for a replacement. You can find replacement brush heads readily available online or at most retailers that sell Bissell products.
